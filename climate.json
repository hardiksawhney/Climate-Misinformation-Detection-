    "text": "WASHINGTON  —   Congressional Republicans have a new fear when it comes to their    health care lawsuit against the Obama administration: They might win. The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit, which challenges the administration’s authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for   and   Americans, handing House Republicans a big victory on    issues. But a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode, leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before Republicans have prepared a replacement. That could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as Republicans gain full control of the government. To stave off that outcome, Republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the Obama health care law, angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years. In another twist, Donald J. Trump’s administration, worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives, could choose to fight its Republican allies in the House on some central questions in the dispute. Eager to avoid an ugly political pileup, Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit, which, after the election, has been put in limbo until at least late February by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They are not yet ready to divulge their strategy. “Given that this pending litigation involves the Obama administration and Congress, it would be inappropriate to comment,” said Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition effort. “Upon taking office, the Trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the Affordable Care Act. ” In a potentially   decision in 2015, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that House Republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the Obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies, in violation of the Constitution, without approval from Congress. The Justice Department, confident that Judge Collyer’s decision would be reversed, quickly appealed, and the subsidies have remained in place during the appeal. In successfully seeking a temporary halt in the proceedings after Mr. Trump won, House Republicans last month told the court that they “and the  ’s transition team currently are discussing potential options for resolution of this matter, to take effect after the  ’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017. ” The suspension of the case, House lawyers said, will “provide the   and his future administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or to otherwise resolve this appeal. ” Republican leadership officials in the House acknowledge the possibility of “cascading effects” if the   payments, which have totaled an estimated $13 billion, are suddenly stopped. Insurers that receive the subsidies in exchange for paying    costs such as deductibles and   for eligible consumers could race to drop coverage since they would be losing money. Over all, the loss of the subsidies could destabilize the entire program and cause a lack of confidence that leads other insurers to seek a quick exit as well. Anticipating that the Trump administration might not be inclined to mount a vigorous fight against the House Republicans given the  ’s dim view of the health care law, a team of lawyers this month sought to intervene in the case on behalf of two participants in the health care program. In their request, the lawyers predicted that a deal between House Republicans and the new administration to dismiss or settle the case “will produce devastating consequences for the individuals who receive these reductions, as well as for the nation’s health insurance and health care systems generally. ” No matter what happens, House Republicans say, they want to prevail on two overarching concepts: the congressional power of the purse, and the right of Congress to sue the executive branch if it violates the Constitution regarding that spending power. House Republicans contend that Congress never appropriated the money for the subsidies, as required by the Constitution. In the suit, which was initially championed by John A. Boehner, the House speaker at the time, and later in House committee reports, Republicans asserted that the administration, desperate for the funding, had required the Treasury Department to provide it despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending was proper. The White House said that the spending was a permanent part of the law passed in 2010, and that no annual appropriation was required  —   even though the administration initially sought one. Just as important to House Republicans, Judge Collyer found that Congress had the standing to sue the White House on this issue  —   a ruling that many legal experts said was flawed  —   and they want that precedent to be set to restore congressional leverage over the executive branch. But on spending power and standing, the Trump administration may come under pressure from advocates of presidential authority to fight the House no matter their shared views on health care, since those precedents could have broad repercussions. It is a complicated set of dynamics illustrating how a quick legal victory for the House in the Trump era might come with costs that Republicans never anticipated when they took on the Obama White House.",

    "text": "After the bullet shells get counted, the blood dries and the votive candles burn out, people peer down from   windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze. The South Bronx, just across the Harlem River from Manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction, still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of New York City. And yet the city’s efforts to fight it remain splintered, underfunded and burdened by scandal. In the 40th Precinct, at the southern tip of the Bronx, as in other poor, minority neighborhoods across the country, people long hounded for   infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death. By September, four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved. Out of the city’s 77 precincts, the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime, reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan, according to a New York Times analysis of Police Department data. Investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends, even as their bosses are called to Police Headquarters to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year. And across the Bronx, investigative resources are squeezed. It has the highest   rate of the city’s five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing. Nine of the 14   precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there. The borough’s robbery squad is smaller than Manhattan’s, even though the Bronx has had 1, 300 more cases this year. And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders, compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper Manhattan and more than one detective per murder in Lower Manhattan. In   lobbies and   family apartments, outside methadone clinics and art studios, people take note of the inequity. They hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a   corner. They watch witnesses cower behind   doors, more fearful of a gunman’s crew than confident in the Police Department’s ability to protect them. So though people see a lot, they rarely testify. And in the South Bronx, as in so many predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods like it in the United States, the contract between the police and the community is in tatters. Some people have stories of crime reports that were ignored, or 911 calls that went unanswered for hours. Others tell of a 911 call for help ending in the caller’s arrest, or of a minor charge leading to 12 hours in a fetid holding cell. This is the paradox of policing in the 40th Precinct. Its neighborhoods have historically been prime targets for aggressive tactics, like    that are designed to ward off disorder. But precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes. Gola White, who was beside her daughter when she was shot and killed in a playground this summer, four years after her son was gunned down in the same housing project, ticked off the public safety resources that she said were scant in Bronx neighborhoods like hers: security cameras, lights, locks, investigating police officers. “Here, we have nothing,” she said. When it comes to “  families,” she said, the authorities “don’t really care as much. That’s how I feel. ” The Times has been documenting the murders logged this year in the 40th Precinct, one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence remains a problem in an era of   crime in New York City. The homicides  —   14 in the precinct this year, up from nine in 2015  —   strain detectives, and when they go unsolved, as half of them have this year, some look to take the law into their own hands. From hundreds of conversations with grieving relatives and friends, witnesses and police officers, the social forces that flare into murder in a place like the 40th Precinct become clearer: merciless gang codes, mental illness, drugs and long memories of feuds that simmered out of officers’ view. The reasons some murders will never be solved also emerge: paralyzing fear of retribution, victims carrying secrets to their graves and relentless casework that forces detectives to move on in hopes that a break will come later. Frustrations build on all sides. Detectives’ phones rarely ring with tips, and officers grow embittered with witnesses who will not cooperate. In the meantime, a victim’s friends conduct their own investigations, and talk of grabbing a stash gun from a wheel well or a mother’s apartment when they find their suspect. In the chasm between the police and the community, gangs and gun violence flourish. Parents try to protect their families from drug crews’ threats, and officers work to overcome the residue of years of mistrust and understaffing in communities where they still go racing from one 911 call to the next. The streets around St. Mary’s Park were the scene of two fatal shootings logged in the 40th Precinct this year. Both are unsolved. James Fernandez heard talk of the murders through the door of his   apartment on East 146th Street in a     the Betances Houses. He lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles, empty dope bags and discarded Hennessy bottles. A   young men who spoke of being in a subset of the Bloods gang had made it their drug market, slinging marijuana and cocaine to regulars, flashing firearms and blowing smoke into the Fernandez apartment. When Mr. Fernandez, 40, asked the young men to move, they answered by busting up his car. This kind of crime, an anachronism in much of New York, still rattles the 40th Precinct, even though murders there have fallen to 14 this year from 83 in 1991. It has more major felony crimes per resident than any other residential district in the city. It is also one of the poorest communities in the country, and many young men find their way into underground markets. Mr. Fernandez was not one to shrink from the threats. When he was growing up on the Lower East Side, he rode his bicycle around to the customers of the drug dealers he worked for and collected payments in a backpack. After leaving that life, he got a tech maintenance job and, three years ago, moved into the Betances Houses with his wife and daughter, now 11. He had two choices to get help with the drug crew: call the police for help and risk being labeled a snitch, or call his old Lower East Side bosses for muscle and risk violence. He chose the police. Again and again, he walked into a local substation, Police Service Area 7, and asked for protection. His daughter was using an inhaler to relieve coughs from the marijuana smoke. Mr. Fernandez and his wife got terrible headaches. “There’s a lot of killers here, and we are going to kill you,” a sergeant’s police report quoted a    telling Mr. Fernandez in August 2015. A second report filed the same day said a    warned him, “I’m going to shoot through your window. ” Mr. Fernandez told the police both the teenagers’ names, which appear in the reports, and then went home. He said one of their friends had seen him walk into the substation, and they tried to intimidate him out of filing another report. Three days later, the same    propped his bike on their door, “then said if I was to open the door and say something, they would body slam me,” Mr. Fernandez’s wife, Maria Fernandez, wrote on slips of paper she used to document the hallway ruckus and the inadequate police response. The boys made comments about how easy a target she was and about how they would have to “slap” her if she opened the door while they made a drug sale, and they threatened to beat the Fernandez family because “they are the ones snitching,” her notes say. But another   complaint at the substation, 10 days after the first, brought no relief. A week later, feeling desperate, Ms. Fernandez tried calling: first to the substation, at 8:50 p. m. when one of the boys blew weed smoke at her door and made a   threat to attack her, and then to 911 at 10:36 p. m. The police never came, she wrote in her notes. She tried the 40th Precinct station house next, but officers at the desk left her standing in the public waiting area for a   she said, making her fear being seen again. Officers put her in worse danger some months later, she said, when they came to her door and announced in front of the teenagers that they were there on a complaint about drug activity. Mr. Fernandez started doing the work that he said the police had failed to do. He wired a camera into his peephole to record the drugs and guns. The footage hark back to the New York of the 1980s, still very much present to some of the precinct’s residents. Around 6:30 each morning, Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th Precinct station house. The cases that land on his metal desk  —   dead bodies with no known cause, strip club brawls, shooting victims hobbling into the hospital themselves  —   bring resistance at every turn, reminding him of an earlier era in the city’s   campaign. “I haven’t got one single phone call that’s putting me in the right direction here,” said Sergeant LoPuzzo, the head of the precinct’s detective squad, one day this summer as he worked on an answer to an email inquiry from a murder victim’s aunt about why the killer had not been caught. “And people just don’t understand that. ” Often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police. Witnesses shout them away from their doors just so neighbors know they refuse to talk. Of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the Bronx through early September, more than a third  —   66 victims  —   refused to cooperate. Over the same period in the 40th Precinct, squad detectives closed three of 17 nonfatal shootings, and 72 of 343 robbery cases. Part of the resistance stems from   preventive policing tactics, like    that were a hallmark of the     style under former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly. Near the height of the    strategy, in 2012, the 40th Precinct had the   stops in the city, the   stops in which officers used force and the most frisks. Of 18, 276 stops that year, 15, 521 were of people who had done nothing criminal. The precinct was also one of the   areas that the department flooded with its newest officers. At roll calls, they were pressured to generate numbers: write tickets and make arrests. They had no choice but to give a summons to a young man playing in a park after dark, even if the officers had done the same growing up in the same neighborhood. “I need to bring something in today to justify my existence,” Officer Argenis Rosado, who joined the precinct in 2010, said in an interview at the station house. “So now you’re in a small area, and day after day you’re hammering the same community. Of course that community’s eventually going to turn on you. ” The pressure warped the way officers and residents saw each other. Rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop. “Some of the cops that came out at that time probably viewed the community differently, too,” said Hector Espada, a   veteran of the precinct. “Not because they wanted to, but because they had to. Because some way or somehow, you can’t give someone a $115 summons and feel like you guys could still have a civil conversation after that. ” Morale wilted in the aged station house on Alexander Avenue, in Mott Haven. Officers felt pressure to downgrade crime complaints to make them appear less serious. Several said in interviews that they had overlooked crime reports from immigrants because they were seen as unlikely to complain, and watched supervisors badger victims into repeating their stories in hopes that they would drop their complaints. The practice of downgrading complaints resulted in the disciplining of 19 officers in the precinct last year, one in a string of scandals that has left officers there feeling overscrutinized for problems that also existed elsewhere. Four commanders in the precinct were sent packing in five years, one of them after officers were found to be “ticket fixing,” or forgiving parking tickets for friends, and another after he was recorded giving guidance on whom to stop and frisk: black boys and men, ages 14 to 21. Some officers fled to other commands. Others became reluctant to take assignments in proactive policing units, like   that put them in   situations on the street. “Whenever I walked through the doors of the precinct, to me, it seemed like a black cloud,” said Russell Lewis, a    of the 40th. “It was like a heaviness. When you walked in, all you wanted to do was do your 8 hours 35 minutes and go home, because you didn’t want to get caught up in anything. ” The precinct covers only about two square miles, but the more than a dozen housing projects there mean that it overflows with people. Methadone clinics draw addicts from around the city.   lofts on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification. Even as the Police Department has hired 1, 300 more officers for neighborhood policing and counterterrorism, officers in the 40th Precinct said they could still rush to 25 911 calls during a shift  —   a number unchanged from what the new police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, said he was handling in a similar South Bronx precinct 15 years ago. Several dozen calls at a time can be waiting for a response. Residents know that if you want the police for a domestic problem, it helps to hint that there is a weapon. Last year, the precinct drew the   number of civilian complaints for officer misconduct in the city, and the most lawsuits stemming from police actions. The precinct is trying to improve morale under a new commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Brian Hennessy. A cadre of what the department calls neighborhood coordination officers has been on patrol since last January, part of a citywide effort under Mr. O’Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio to bring back the beat cop, unencumbered by chasing every last 911 call, who can listen to people’s concerns and help with investigations. The precinct has made among the most gun arrests in the city, and officers said they now had more discretion to resolve encounters without a summons or an arrest. At one corner near a school, on Courtlandt Avenue and East 151st Street, that has long spawned complaints about gunfire and fights, Inspector Hennessy and some of his officers painted over graffiti and swept up drug paraphernalia this summer. People said it was the first answer to their complaints in years. But the inspector acknowledged that the residue of   policing lingers. “That perception really sticks,” he said. The workload in the 40th Precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in Manhattan compared with the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. Three of the precinct’s 16 detectives are carrying more than 400 cases each this year, and many others have loads in the high 300s, even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts. When they are assigned a homicide, they typically have four days to investigate before dealing with other cases. Quieter precincts can give detectives a month with little distraction to investigate a murder. Detectives in the 40th Precinct have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through    —   murders, rapes, felony assaults and robberies. By contrast, a detective in the precinct on the southern end of Staten Island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling Union Square and Gramercy Park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of Washington Heights handles 32, the citywide median. Last year, the 40th was the    for violent crime, with 65 cases per detective. In the Bronx as a whole, a precinct detective has carried an average of 58 violent felonies this year, compared with 27 in Manhattan, 37 in Brooklyn, 38 in Queens and 25 on Staten Island. Rape cases and robbery patterns are later sent to more specialized units, but precinct detectives do extensive initial work to interview victims, write reports and process evidence. Precincts in much of Manhattan, which are whiter and wealthier than the South Bronx, often have more property felonies, like stolen laptops or credit cards, and the police say those can be complex. But even accounting for those crimes, the 40th Precinct has some of the heaviest caseloads of overall crime per detective in the city. Michael Palladino, the head of the Detectives’ Endowment Association and a former Bronx officer, said staffing disparities affected the department’s efforts to build trust in communities like the South Bronx. Witnesses make a calculation, he said: “If I cooperate with the detectives, there’s so much work, there’s so few of them there, they won’t even get the chance to protect me, or they’ll be there too late when the retaliation comes. ” Sergeant LoPuzzo, who turned down a more prestigious post to stay in the 40th Precinct, said that his squad worked tirelessly to handle cases with the people he had, and that while every squad wanted more detectives, staffing needs for counterterrorism units and task forces had created new deployment challenges across the department. “We fight with the army we have, not the army we wish we had,” he said. Details of how the Police Department assigns its 36, 000 officers are closely held and constantly in flux, and the public has minimal information on how personnel are allocated. Presented with The Times’s analysis of confidential staffing data, the department’s chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, vowed to send more detectives to the 40th Precinct and said the department would reassess its deployment more broadly in troubled precincts. He said a recent decision to bring gang, narcotics and vice detectives under his command made it easier to shift personnel. Chief Boyce said the burdens on detectives went beyond felony crimes to include   and   cases. And he noted the support that precinct squads got from centralized units focusing on robberies, gangs or grand larcenies, for example. Major crime keeps pounding the 40th Precinct, at rates that in 2015 were only a tenth of a percent lower than in 2001, even as citywide crime dropped by more than a third over the same period. But the precinct’s detective squad shrank by about eight investigators during those years, according to staffing data obtained from the City Council through a Freedom of Information Law request. The squad covering Union Square and Gramercy Park, where crime dropped by a third over that period, grew by about 11 investigators. (The 40th Precinct was given an additional detective and four   investigators this summer, when it was already missing three detectives for illness or other reasons.) Retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the city’s last “” the busiest precincts. Rather, they say, the Police Department should be dedicating more resources to providing the same sort of robust investigative response that seems standard in Manhattan. “Any crime in Manhattan has to be solved,” said Howard Landesberg, who was a 40th Precinct detective in the late 1980s. “The outer boroughs are, like, forgotten. ” Retired detectives said that understaffing made it harder to solve crimes in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, where the higher prevalence of gang and drug killings already saddled investigators with cases in which people were not inclined to cooperate. Through   detectives had closed 67 percent of homicides in Manhattan and 76 percent of those in Staten Island this year, compared with 54 percent of those in the Bronx, 42 percent of those in Queens and 31 percent of those in Brooklyn. Of last year’s homicides, detectives cleared 71 percent in Manhattan, 63 percent in the Bronx, 62 percent in Queens, 57 percent in Staten Island and 31 percent in Brooklyn. “It’s the culture of the Police Department that they worry about Manhattan,” said Joseph L. Giacalone, a former sergeant in the Bronx Cold Case Squad, in part “because that’s where the money is. ” He added: “When de Blasio came in, he talked about the tale of two cities. And then he’s done the complete opposite of what he said. It’s just business as usual. ” The Bronx’s struggles extend into prosecutions. In each of the last five years, prosecutors in the Bronx have declined to prosecute violent felony cases more than anywhere else in the city. And the rate of conviction in the Bronx is routinely the lowest in the city as well, but has ticked up this year to surpass Brooklyn’s rate through November as Bronx prosecutors work to streamline cases. Some cases have become even more difficult to win because of the   problem in the 40th Precinct, which has allowed defense lawyers to attack the credibility of officers who were implicated, said Patrice O’Shaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the Bronx District Attorney’s office. The district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, elected in 2015, said in a statement, “I was a judge here in the Bronx, and I heard from jurors that they can’t be impartial because they don’t trust the police. ” Against that tide of mistrust, Sergeant LoPuzzo’s detectives work 36 hours straight on some fresh cases. They buy Chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect. They carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer. They buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered son’s ashes in a box. In the months after a killing, they can seem like the only people in this glittering city who are paying attention to the 40th Precinct’s homicide victims. Newly fatherless children go back to school without a therapist’s help. Victims’ families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance. Newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts, pushing them down the priority lists of the   chiefs at Police Headquarters. In a stuffy   squad room, the detectives of the 40th Precinct grapple with an inheritance of government neglect. They meet mothers who believe their sons might never have been murdered had a city guidance counselor listened to pleas to help them stay enrolled, or had a city housing worker fixed the locks or lights on a building. And the detectives work alongside a vicious system on the streets for punishing police cooperators. Young men scan court paperwork in prison, looking for the names of people who turned on them. One murder victim in the precinct this year was cast out of his crew after he avoided being arrested with them in a gang takedown some believed he was cooperating. A longtime 40th Precinct detective, Jeff Meenagh, said a witness in a homicide case was going to testify until he went back to his neighborhood and was told that anyone who testified would “get what you deserve. ” The allies Sergeant LoPuzzo makes are friendly only for so long. He helped clear a woman’s son of a robbery charge by locating surveillance video that proved he was not the robber. The mother started calling with tips under a code name  —   about a gun under a car, for example. But she always refused to testify. And she cut ties this year after Sergeant LoPuzzo arrested her son in the stabbing of two people and her   in a shooting. New York City owns East 146th Street and the   buildings on each side. But James Fernandez, in the Betances Houses, said the reality on the ground was different: The drug boss ran the block. By October, Mr. Fernandez was increasingly afraid  —   and fed up. Mr. Fernandez and his wife went so far as to give officers keys to the building door, so they could get in whenever they wanted, showed them the videos and offered them   access to his camera so they could see what was happening in the hallway. A couple of officers said they needed a supervisor’s permission to do more. Others answered that the young men were only making threats. Officers occasionally stopped outside their building, causing the young men to scatter, but did not come inside, Mr. Fernandez said. The menacing worsened. Mr. Fernandez’s daughter was harassed as she arrived home from school. She grew more and more distressed, and her parents had her start seeing a therapist. Mr. Fernandez made several complaints at the office of the borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr. and visited a victim’s advocate in the district attorney’s office. On Oct. 20, 2015, he sent an online note to the police commissioner’s office. “We went to all proper channels for help,” the note said. “Both precincts failed us, except 2 officers who helped us, but their hands are tied. No one else to turn to. I have months of video of multiple crimes taking place and we are in extreme danger. ” “40th and PSA 7 won’t do anything,” he wrote, referring to the local substation. “Please we need to speak to some one with authority. ” The local substation commander, Deputy Inspector Jerry O’Sullivan, and the Bronx narcotics unit were alerted to the complaints. But Mr. Fernandez said he never heard from them. So he relied on his own street instincts to protect his family. He made pleas to a man he thought was employing the dealers in the hallway. The activity quieted briefly, but it returned after the young men rented a room in a woman’s apartment upstairs. Mr. Fernandez approached a different man who he learned was the boss of the operation. The man agreed to ask the dealers to calm down. He even hired a drug customer to sweep the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said. But two weeks later, the dealing and the harassment resumed. So he went to his old Lower East Side bosses, who hired men to trail his wife and daughter on their way out of the building and make sure they made it safely to school. At other times they sat outside the Betances Houses. He also bought two bulletproof vests, for about $700 each. He could not find one small enough for his daughter. “I have no faith in the City of New York, I have no faith in the police, I have no faith in the politicians,” Mr. Fernandez said. “The only thing I know for sure: God, if we’re in a situation again, I will be left to defend my family. ” Paying such close attention to what was happening in the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said he learned some details about two recent homicides that the 40th Precinct was investigating. But because his calls for help were going nowhere, he said he decided not to put himself in greater risk by talking: He would not tell the police what he had learned. “I’m bending over backward, and nobody’s not even doing anything,” he said. “Why am I going to help you, if you ain’t going to help me?” By last January, a new neighborhood coordination officer was working with residents of the Betances Houses, and ended up with the most arrests in his housing command, Inspector O’Sullivan said. Chief Boyce said that the silos in which gang and narcotics detectives used to work made responding to complaints more difficult, but that the recent restructuring would remove those obstacles. “No one should live like Mr. Fernandez lived, with people dealing drugs outside of his apartment,” he said. Mr. Fernandez’s complaints did not spur any arrests, but two men from the hallway were caught separately this year in shootings. One of them, whom Mr. Fernandez named in a police report, was charged this summer with hitting an officer with a metal folding chair and firing three gunshots into a crowd, court papers say. He is being held on Rikers Island on an attempted murder charge. That was too late for Mr. Fernandez. By May, he had moved his family away.",

    "text": "When Walt Disney’s “Bambi” opened in 1942, critics praised its spare, haunting visual style, vastly different from anything Disney had done before. But what they did not know was that the film’s striking appearance had been created by a Chinese immigrant artist, who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the Song dynasty. The extent of his contribution to “Bambi,” which remains a   mark for film animation, would not be widely known for decades. Like the film’s title character, the artist, Tyrus Wong, weathered irrevocable separation from his mother  —   and, in the hope of making a life in America, incarceration, isolation and rigorous interrogation  —   all when he was still a child. In the years that followed, he endured poverty, discrimination and chronic lack of recognition, not only for his work at Disney but also for his fine art, before finding acclaim in his 90s. Mr. Wong died on Friday at 106. A Hollywood studio artist, painter, printmaker, calligrapher,   illustrator and, in later years, maker of fantastical kites, he was one of the most celebrated   artists of the 20th century. But because of the marginalization to which   were long subject, he passed much of his career unknown to the general public. Artistic recognition, when Mr. Wong did find it, was all the more noteworthy for the fact that among Chinese immigrant men of his generation, professional prospects were largely limited to menial jobs like houseboy and laundryman. Trained as a painter, Mr. Wong was a leading figure in the Modernist movement that flourished in California between the first and second World Wars. In 1932 and again in 1934, his work was included in group shows at the Art Institute of Chicago that also featured Picasso, Matisse and Paul Klee. As a staff artist for Hollywood studios from the 1930s to the 1960s, he drew storyboards and made vibrant paintings, as detailed as any architectural illustrations, that helped the director envision each scene before it was shot. Over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for Disney and   films for Warner Brothers and other studios, among them “The Sands of Iwo Jima” (1949) “Rebel Without a Cause” (1955) and “The Wild Bunch” (1969). But of the dozens of films on which he worked, it was for “Bambi” that Mr. Wong was  —   belatedly  —   most renowned. “He was truly involved with every phase of production,” John Canemaker, an   animator and a historian of animation at New York University, said in an interview for this obituary in March. “He created an art direction that had really never been seen before in animation. ” In 2013 and 2014, Mr. Wong was the subject of “Water to Paper, Paint to Sky,” a major retrospective at the Disney Family Museum in San Francisco. From the museum’s windows, which overlook San Francisco Bay, he could contemplate Angel Island, where more than nine decades earlier, as a lone    he had sought to gain admission to a country that adamantly did not want him. Wong Gen Yeo (the name is sometimes Romanized Wong Gaing Yoo) was born on Oct. 25, 1910, in a farming village in Guangdong Province. As a young child, he already exhibited a love of drawing and was encouraged by his father. In 1920, seeking better economic prospects, Gen Yeo and his father embarked for the United States, leaving his mother and sister behind. Gen Yeo would never see his mother again. They were obliged to travel under false identities  —   a state of affairs known among Chinese immigrants as being a “paper son”  —   in the hope of circumventing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur, the act, which drastically curtailed the number of Chinese people allowed to enter the country, was among the earliest United States laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration. But in 1906, an unforeseen loophole opened in the form of the San Francisco earthquake and fire. Because a huge number of municipal documents, including birth and immigration records, were destroyed, many newly arrived Chinese capitalized on the loss, maintaining that they had been born in San Francisco before the fire. As United States citizens, they were entitled to bring over their relatives  —   or, in the case of Gen Yeo and his father, “paper sons” posing as relatives. Attuned to the deception, United States immigration officials put Chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be. The questions came like gunfire: In which direction does your village face? How many windows are in your house? Where in the house is the rice bin? How wide is your well? How deep? Are there trees in your village? Are there lakes? What shops can you name? The sponsoring relative was interrogated separately, and the answers had to match. For the new arrival, a major mistake, or a series of smaller ones, could mean deportation. To stand a chance of passing, aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers. The ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults.    Gen Yeo would undergo it alone. On Dec. 30, 1920, after a month at sea, the Wongs landed at Angel Island Immigration Station. The elder Mr. Wong was traveling as a merchant named Look Get his son as Look Tai Yow. “Angel Island is considered to be the Ellis Island of the West Coast,” Lisa See, the author of “On Gold Mountain” (1995) a nonfiction chronicle of her   family, said in an interview in 2016. However, she continued: “The goal was really very different than Ellis Island, which was supposed to be so welcoming. Angel Island opened very specifically to keep the Chinese out. ” Because Mr. Wong’s father had previously lived in the United States as Look Get, he was able to clear Immigration quickly. But as a new arrival, Gen Yeo was detained on the island for nearly a month, the only child among the immigrants being held there. “I was scared half to death I just cried,” Mr. Wong recalled in “Tyrus,” an   documentary directed by Pamela Tom, which premiered in 2015. “Every day is just miserable  —   miserable. I hated that place. ” On Jan. 27, 1921, in the presence of an interpreter and a stenographer, young Gen Yeo, posing as Look Tai Yow, was interrogated by three inspectors. His father had already been questioned. Gen Yeo was well prepared and answered without error. In Sacramento, where he joined his father, a schoolteacher Americanized “Tai Yow” to “Tyrus,” and he was known as Tyrus Wong ever after. Soon afterward, father and son were separated once more, when the elder Mr. Wong moved to Los Angeles to seek work. For reasons that have been lost to time, he could not take his son. Tyrus lived on his own in a Sacramento boardinghouse while attending elementary school. Two years later  —   possibly more  —   Tyrus traveled to Los Angeles to join his father, who had found work in a gambling den. They lived in a   boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel. After school, Tyrus worked as a houseboy for two Pasadena families, earning 50 cents a day. His first art teacher was his father, who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper: They could not afford ink or drawing paper. When Tyrus was in junior high, a teacher, noting his drawing talent, arranged a summer scholarship to the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. By his own account an indifferent student in public school, Tyrus found his calling at the institute, now the Otis College of Art and Design. When his scholarship ended he declined to return to junior high. His father scraped together the $90 tuition  —   a small fortune  —   to let him stay on as Otis’s youngest student. He studied there for at least five years, simultaneously working as the school janitor, before graduating in the 1930s. Not long afterward his father died, leaving young Mr. Wong entirely on his own. From 1936 to 1938, Mr. Wong was an artist for the Works Progress Administration, creating paintings for libraries and other public spaces. With friends, including the   artist Benji Okubo, he founded the Oriental Artists’ Group of Los Angeles, which organized exhibitions of members’ work  —   an   level of exposure for Asian artists at the time. Mr. Wong, newly married and needing steady work, joined Disney in 1938 as an “” creating the thousands of intermediate drawings that bring animated sequences to life. Asians were then a novelty at Hollywood studios, and Mr. Wong was made keenly aware of the fact, first at Disney and later at Warner Brothers. One   flung a racial epithet at him. Another assumed on sight that he worked in the company cafeteria. Then there was the affront of the  ’s job itself: Painstaking, repetitive and for Mr. Wong quickly   it is the   work of animation  —   “a terrible use of his talents as a landscape artist and a painter,” Mr. Canemaker said. A reprieve came in the late 1930s, when Mr. Wong learned that Disney was adapting “Bambi, a Life in the Woods,” the 1923 novel by the Austrian writer Felix Salten about a fawn whose mother is killed by a hunter. In trying to animate the book, Disney had reached an impasse. The studio had enjoyed great success in 1937 with its animated film “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” a baroque production in which every detail of the backgrounds  —   every petal on every flower, every leaf on every tree  —   was meticulously represented. In an attempt to use a similar style for “Bambi,” it found that the ornate backgrounds camouflaged the deer and other forest creatures on which the narrative centered. Mr. Wong spied his chance. “I said, ‘Gee, this is all outdoor scenery,’” he recalled in a video interview years afterward, adding: “I said, ‘Gee, I’m a landscape painter! ’” Invoking the exquisite landscape paintings of the Song dynasty (A. D. 960 —  1279) he rendered in watercolors and pastels a series of nature scenes that were moody, lyrical and atmospheric  —   at once lush and spare  —   with backgrounds subtly suggested by a stroke or two of the brush. “Walt Disney went crazy over them,” said Mr. Canemaker, who wrote about Mr. Wong in his book “Before the Animation Begins: The Art and Lives of Disney Inspirational Sketch Artists” (1996). “He said, ‘I love this indefinite quality, the mysterious quality of the forest. ’” Mr. Wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist. “But he was more than that,” Mr. Canemaker explained. “He was the designer he was the person they went to when they had questions about the color, about how to lay something out. He even influenced the music and the special effects: Just by the look of the drawings, he inspired people. ” Mr. Wong spent two years painting the illustrations that would inform every aspect of “Bambi. ” Throughout the finished film  —   lent a brooding quality by its stark landscapes misty, desaturated palette and figures often seen in silhouette  —   his influence is unmistakable. But in 1941, in the wake of a bitter employees’ strike that year, Disney fired Mr. Wong. Though he had chosen not to strike  —   he felt the studio had been good to him, Mr. Canemaker said  —   he was let go amid the lingering climate of   resentments. On “Bambi,” Mr. Wong’s name appears, quite far down in the credits, as a mere “background” artist. Mr. Wong joined Warner Brothers in 1942, working there  —   and lent out on occasion to other studios  —   until his retirement in 1968. The indignities he endured were not confined to the studios. Trying to buy a house, he and his wife, the former Ruth Kim, were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold. “Then in a month you’d go back there and the sign was still there,” Mr. Wong recalled in “Tyrus. ” After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Mr. Wong, like many   took to wearing a lapel button proclaiming his heritage, lest an angry American beat him up on the street. The war permanently dispersed the fledgling Oriental Artists’ Group. Mr. Wong’s friend Mr. Okubo was sent, with tens of thousands of other   to an internment camp. “If World War II hadn’t happened when it did, I think these artists, even the   artists, would have more of a name than they do today,” Ms. See said. “And that’s because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war. ” Mr. Wong, who became a United States citizen in 1946, also designed Christmas cards for Hallmark and painted elegant   designs on dinnerware, now sought after by collectors. A longtime resident of Sunland, Calif. he became, in retirement, a renowned kitemaker, designing, building and hand coloring astonishing, airworthy creations  —   butterflies, swallows, whole flocks of owls, centipedes more than 100 feet long  —   that streaked the Southern California sky like paint on blue canvas. During the last 15 years of Ruth Wong’s life, when she was ill with dementia, Mr. Wong forsook his work to care for her. After her death in 1995, he slowly began making art again. In 2001, in formal recognition of his influence on “Bambi,” Mr. Wong was named a Disney Legend. The honor  —   whose previous recipients include Fred MacMurray, Julie Andrews and Annette Funicello  —   is bestowed by the Walt Disney Company for outstanding contributions. In 2003, a retrospective of his work, curated in part by Ms. See, was the inaugural exhibition at the Chinese American Museum in Los Angeles. The Disney Family Museum’s retrospective, “Water to Paper, Paint to Sky,” traveled in 2015 to the Museum of Chinese in America, in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Wong’s death, at his home in Sunland, was confirmed by the filmmaker Ms. Tom. His survivors include three daughters, Kay Fong,   Wong and Kim Wong and two grandchildren. When his daughters were small, Mr. Wong encouraged them to make art, as his father had encouraged him. Yet he would not let them have coloring books. The reason was simple: He did not want his children constrained, he said, by lines laid down by others.",

    "text": "SEOUL, South Korea  —   North Korea’s leader, Kim   said on Sunday that his country was making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile  —   a bold statement less than a month before the inauguration of   Donald J. Trump. Although North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the last decade and more than 20 ballistic missile tests in 2016 alone, and although it habitually threatens to attack the United States with nuclear weapons, the country has never   an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. In his annual New Year’s Day speech, which was broadcast on the North’s   KCTV on Sunday, Mr. Kim spoke proudly of the strides he said his country had made in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. He said North Korea would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as the United States remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with South Korea. “We have reached the final stage in preparations to   an intercontinental ballistic rocket,” he said. Analysts in the region have said Mr. Kim might conduct another weapons test in coming months, taking advantage of leadership changes in the United States and South Korea. Mr. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20. In South Korea, President Park   whose powers were suspended in a Parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9, is waiting for the Constitutional Court to rule on whether she should be formally removed from office or reinstated. If North Korea conducts a    test in coming months, it will test Mr. Trump’s new administration despite years of increasingly harsh sanctions, North Korea has been advancing toward Mr. Kim’s professed goal of arming his isolated country with the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States. Mr. Kim’s speech on Sunday indicated that North Korea may   a   rocket several times this year to complete its ICBM program, said Cheong   a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. The first of such tests could come even before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Cheong said. “We need to take note of the fact that this is the first New Year’s speech where Kim   mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile,” he said. In his speech, Mr. Kim did not comment on Mr. Trump’s election. Doubt still runs deep that North Korea has mastered all the technology needed to build a reliable ICBM. But analysts in the region said the North’s launchings of   rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles. After the North’s satellite launch in February, South Korean defense officials said the Unha rocket used in the launch, if successfully reconfigured as a missile, could fly more than 7, 400 miles with a warhead of 1, 100 to 1, 300 pounds  —   far enough to reach most of the United States. North Korea has deployed Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of South Korea and Japan, but it has had a spotty record in   the Musudan, its   ballistic missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in the Pacific, including those on Guam. The North has also claimed a series of successes in testing various ICBM technologies, although its claims cannot be verified and are often disputed by officials and analysts in the region. It has said it could now make nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile. It also claimed success in testing the   technology that allows a   missile to return to the Earth’s atmosphere without breaking up. In April, North Korea reported the successful ground test of an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile. At the time, Mr. Kim said the North “can tip   intercontinental ballistic rockets with more powerful nuclear warheads and keep any cesspool of evils in the Earth, including the U. S. mainland, within our striking range. ” On Sept. 9, the North conducted its fifth, and most powerful, nuclear test. Mr. Kim later attended another ground test of a new   rocket engine, exhorting his government to prepare for another rocket launch as soon as possible. In November, the United Nations Security Council imposed new  sanctions against the North.",

    "text": "LONDON  —   Queen Elizabeth II, who has been battling a cold for more than a week, missed a New Year’s Day church service at her country estate in Sandringham, Buckingham Palace said on Sunday. A week earlier, the queen, who is 90, missed a Christmas Day church service, for the first time since 1988, because of the illness. “The Queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold,” the palace said in a statement. The queen’s husband, Prince Philip, who had also been ill, was well enough to attend both services, in the church at Sandringham, which is in Norfolk, on the east coast of England. The queen, who ascended to the throne in 1952, became the world’s   monarch following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand in October. She is also Britain’s   monarch, having last year surpassed Queen Victoria’s   reign. Her mother lived until the age of 101.",

    "text": "BEIJING  —   President Tsai   of Taiwan sharply criticized China’s leaders on Saturday, saying they had resorted to military and economic threats in order to intimidate the island. “Step by step, Beijing is going back to the old path of dividing, coercing and even threatening and intimidating Taiwan,” she told journalists in Taipei, the capital, at a   news conference. Tensions between Taiwan and China, which have been rivals since the Communist Revolution of 1949, intensified in December after Ms. Tsai spoke on the phone with the American   Donald J. Trump, breaking a longstanding diplomatic practice. In recent weeks, China has stepped up military activities near Taiwan, sending its sole aircraft carrier through the waters near the island and dispatching military planes in the region. On Monday, Beijing announced that São Tomé and Príncipe, an island nation off the west coast of Africa that was one of Taiwan’s fewer than two dozen remaining diplomatic allies, had switched its allegiance to the mainland, provoking an outcry in Taiwan. Despite Beijing’s recent actions, which she said had “hurt the feelings” of the Taiwanese people and destabilized relations, Ms. Tsai vowed to avoid a confrontation. “We will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation,” she said. Ms. Tsai faces the delicate task of registering discontent with Beijing while also sending a message that Taiwan will exercise restraint. The United States, which sees Taiwan as one of its most reliable allies in Asia and has sold billions of dollars of weapons to the island, has long sought to avoid a conflict between the two sides. But the election of Mr. Trump could complicate matters. He has antagonized Beijing with a series of critical comments. The   has also questioned the One China policy, which has underpinned relations between Washington and Beijing for decades, and criticized China’s military buildup in the disputed South China Sea. Bonnie S. Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Ms. Tsai’s words might reassure American officials that she would not pursue rash policies in the face of China’s show of strength. “She remains calm, rational and patient,” Ms. Glaser wrote in an email. Still, Ms. Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally favored independence for Taiwan, could face serious challenges in the coming months. Many people in Taiwan are nervous that Mr. Trump will use the island as a bargaining chip against China. And Ms. Tsai’s preference for stability in the region may not mesh with Mr. Trump’s bombastic style. Richard C. Bush, the director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Ms. Tsai understood the need to “maintain a balance among relations with China, relations with the United States and domestic politics. ” Ms. Tsai’s vision, however, “may not align well with the incoming Trump administration’s apparent belief that it can pressure China on all fronts more than the Obama administration has,” he said. Ms. Tsai also sought to quell concerns about planned stopovers in Houston and San Francisco during a visit to Central America scheduled for January. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday called on the United States to block Ms. Tsai from entering the country, warning that such a visit would embolden independence activists in Taiwan. Ms. Tsai described the visit as “unofficial,” saying, “A transit stop is just a transit stop. ”",

    "text": "With Donald J. Trump about to take control of the White House, it would seem a dark time for the renewable energy industry. After all, Mr. Trump has mocked the science of global warming as a Chinese hoax, threatened to kill a global deal on climate change and promised to restore the coal industry to its former glory. So consider what happened in the middle of December, after investors had had a month to absorb the implications of Mr. Trump’s victory. The federal government opened bidding on a tract of the ocean floor off New York State as a potential site for a huge wind farm. Up, up and away soared the offers  —   interest from the bidders was so fevered that the auction went through 33 rounds and spilled over to a second day. In the end, the winning bidder offered the federal Treasury $42 million, more than twice what the government got in August for oil leases  —   oil leases  —   in the Gulf of Mexico. Who won the bid? None other than Statoil, the Norwegian oil company, which is in the midst of a major campaign to turn itself into a big player in renewable energy. We do not know for sure that the New York wind farm will get built, but we do know this: The energy transition is real, and Mr. Trump is not going to stop it. On a global scale, more than half the investment in new electricity generation is going into renewable energy. That is more than $300 billion a year, a sign of how powerful the momentum has become. Wind power is booming in the United States, with the industry adding manufacturing jobs in the reddest states. When Mr. Trump’s appointees examine the facts, they will learn that   technician is projected to be the   occupation in America over the next decade. The election of Mr. Trump left climate activists and environmental groups in despair. They had pinned their hopes on a Hillary Clinton victory and a continuation of President Obama’s strong push to tackle global warming. Now, of course, everything is in flux. In the worst case, with a sufficiently pliant Congress, Mr. Trump could roll back a decade of progress on climate change. Barring some miraculous conversion on Mr. Trump’s part, his election cannot be interpreted as anything but bad news for the climate agenda. Yet despair might be an overreaction. For starters, when Mr. Trump gets to the White House, he will find that the federal government actually has relatively little control over American energy policy, and particularly over electricity generation. The coal industry has been ravaged in part by cheap natural gas, which is abundant because of technological changes in the way it is produced, and there is no lever in the Oval Office that Mr. Trump can pull to reverse that. The intrinsically weak federal role was a source of frustration for Mr. Obama and his aides, but now it will work to the benefit of environmental advocates. They have already persuaded more than half the states to adopt mandates on renewable energy. Efforts to roll those back have largely failed, with the latest development coming only last week, when Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, vetoed a rollback bill. The federal government does offer important subsidies for renewable energy, and they will surely become a target in the new Congress. But those subsidies are already scheduled to fall drastically over five years, in a deal cut a year ago that gave the oil industry some favors and that passed Congress with many Republican votes. If Mr. Trump pushes for an early end to the subsidies, he will find that renewable energy has friends in the Republican Party. Topping that list is Charles E. Grassley, the senior senator from Iowa. That state  —     in presidential politics, let us remember  —   will soon be getting 40 percent of its electricity from wind power. “Senator Grassley has been and continues to be an extraordinary leader and champion for the wind industry,” said Tom Kiernan, the head of the American Wind Energy Association, a trade group. When I spoke with him last week, Mr. Kiernan did not sound like a man gnashing his teeth about the impending Trump era. By his group’s calculations, $80 billion of wind industry investment is in the pipeline for the United States over the next few years. “We are creating jobs throughout America,   jobs, and we think   Trump will want that to continue,” he said. If Mr. Trump really wanted to roll back the clock, he could try to get Congress to override all the state mandates, a gross violation of the supposed conservative commitment to federalism. But it would be a titanic fight, some Republican senators would defect on principle, and Mr. Trump would almost certainly lose. So if the damage Mr. Trump can do domestically is limited by circumstance, what about the international effort against global warming? That is the prospect that has David G. Victor most worried. Dr. Victor, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, is one of the closest observers of global climate politics. While the nations of the world agreed a year ago to a landmark deal to tackle global warming, that consensus is fragile, he pointed out. The Paris Agreement is really an outline more promise than reality. Mr. Trump has vowed to withdraw. Right now, other countries are saying they will go forward even if he does so, but it is not hard to imagine the thing unraveling. As part of the negotiations, the Obama administration promised billions of dollars from American taxpayers to help poor countries adjust to the devastation of global warming. “That’s a big part of the glue that held the Paris deal together,” Dr. Victor pointed out. Mr. Trump is considered likely to abandon that pledge. Perhaps the biggest threat to the climate agenda posed by the incoming administration is not anything that Mr. Trump might do, but rather what he will not do. While the energy transition is real, it is still in its earliest stages. Iowa may soon get 40 percent of its power from wind, but for the United States as a whole, the figure is closer to 5 percent. The transition is simply not happening fast enough. The pledges countries made in Paris, even if kept, are not ambitious enough. To meet the climate goals embodied in the Paris Agreement, the world needed an American president who would have pushed hard to accelerate the energy transition. You can debate whether Mrs. Clinton would have been that president, but it is certainly clear that Mr. Trump will not be. So as Washington goes into reverse gear on climate policy, seas will keep rising and heat waves will get worse. Later this month, global monitoring agencies are expected to report that 2016 was the hottest year in the historical record, beating out 2015, which beat out 2014. If nothing else, the next four years may be a fascinating test of just how far politics can become divorced from physical reality.",

    "text": "Finally. The Second Avenue subway opened in New York City on Sunday, with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making. They descended beneath the streets of the Upper East Side of Manhattan to board Q trains bound for Coney Island in Brooklyn. They cheered. Their eyes filled with tears. They snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations. It was the first day of 2017, and it felt like a new day for a city that for so long struggled to build this sorely needed subway line. In a rare display of unbridled optimism from hardened New Yorkers, they arrived with huge grins and wide eyes, taking in the bells and whistles at three new stations. “I was very choked up,” Betsy Morris, 70, said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th Street station, at noon. “How do you explain something that you never thought would happen? It’s going to change the way everybody lives as far as commuting goes. ” It was a major moment for New York’s sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of Manhattan the subway did not reach. The opening of the first segment of the line  —   an extension of the Q train to 96th Street  —   promises to lighten the crush of passengers on the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 trains along Lexington Avenue, the nation’s most overcrowded subway line, which had been the only line on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. When the stations opened shortly before noon, they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old, and strollers, suitcases and dogs  —   all familiar sights across the system. But for all the excitement, the line, with just three new stops, is much more modest than the ambitious route running the length of Manhattan that was once envisioned. It serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city, which has more than eight and a half million people and many   and minority residents who live far from a subway line. With the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948, much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays, even as subway and bus fares are expected to rise again in March. Still, there was reason to cheer. The opening of a new subway line is a rare occasion in the United States and comes at a time of mounting concern about the deteriorating state of the nation’s infrastructure, from its roadways and bridges to its public transit systems. Few new subway stations have opened in recent years, even as expansive subway networks have sprouted in Asia, and most American cities never built any in the first place. The major subways in the Northeast  —   in New York, Washington and Boston  —   are grappling with old equipment and funding shortfalls, with Washington experiencing a near meltdown over safety problems. With mounting bills for basic maintenance, these subways have largely failed to grow. So the arrival of the   Second Avenue subway, which was first proposed in the 1920s, was a notable achievement for the   Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city’s vast network of subways, buses and commuter railroads. The first phase of the project took nearly a decade to build and cost about $4. 4 billion. With the opening, the map of the city’s loved and loathed subway adds three new stations, bringing the total to 472  —   the most of any subway in the world. A station that opened at Hudson Yards on Manhattan’s Far West Side in 2015 was the city’s first new station in a  . On Sunday, New Yorkers were mesmerized by the artwork adorning the walls. At the 72nd Street stop, Sumana Harihareswara stopped to gaze at a mosaic of a woman of South Asian descent dressed in a burgundy sari, looking at her cellphone. Ms. Harihareswara was overcome with emotion. “I don’t think I’ve ever come across subway art before that makes me feel so seen,” she said through tears. “This woman could be my aunt she could be my cousin. ” She and a stranger exchanged a knowing glance. “Representation matters,” they agreed. Ms. Harihareswara, a longtime transit enthusiast from Astoria, Queens, said she was struck by the diversity portrayed in the mosaics, including a mural of a gay couple holding hands. “There is no feeling quite like seeing yourself cemented into the infrastructure of New York,” Ms. Harihareswara said. After decades of aborted efforts to build the Second Avenue line, and at least three groundbreakings in the 1970s, construction on the current segment began in 2007. The line was originally projected to open in 2013, but subway officials pushed the deadline to the end of 2016 many years ago. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who effectively controls the authority, pressed officials to meet the December 2016 deadline even as concerns grew that the subway would not be ready in time. Still, the agency made the deadline  —   just barely  —   with a lavish inaugural ride on New Year’s Eve for a collection of dignitaries that culminated in a midnight toast. Although many New Yorkers believe the city runs the subways, it is actually the governor who appoints the authority’s chairman and holds considerable sway over the agency. Mr. Cuomo has capitalized on the Second Avenue opening to raise his national profile, overshadowing his frequent nemesis Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who attended the inaugural ride on Saturday but was not given a speaking slot. Despite general good will over the opening, some transit advocates expressed concerns over the high cost of the project and questioned whether officials would move aggressively to extend the line to 125th Street in East Harlem as planned. On Sunday morning, Mr. Cuomo arrived at the 96th Street station with the authority’s chairman, Thomas F. Prendergast, to join the first trip for regular riders, who cheered as the train pulled out of the station. Then Mr. Cuomo’s voice came over the loudspeaker. “Rest assured: I’m not driving the train,” he joked. The first day of service was smooth, although there were a few hiccups. Around 3 p. m. there were delays on the Q line because of a train with mechanical problems at the City Hall station. About an hour earlier, the elevator at the new 86th Street stop had begun to malfunction, stranding passengers above and below ground. Strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators. Parents became upset. Jill Tallmer, 62, and her mother, Margot Tallmer, 91, contemplated visiting another day. “We’ve been waiting for 10 years, or more, to ride,” the younger Ms. Tallmer said while standing with her mother, a lifelong New Yorker who is in a wheelchair. “Hopefully, it’s almost ready for us. ” It was not, and they left after a few minutes. At the 72nd Street station, George Braith, a jazz saxophonist, was being mobbed by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi. The reason for his newfound celebrity: His likeness is featured in a mosaic there. “Would you look at that guy?” Mr. Braith, 77, said. “Pretty handsome fellow if you ask me. ” He is one of several local celebrities portrayed in the artwork, including chef Daniel Boulud. In Mr. Braith’s mosaic, he is clad in a slick red blazer and carrying his signature Braithophone, alto and soprano saxophones melded into one. Taking the instrument from his suitcase, he obliged the crowd with a brief tune. “Are you famous?” a   asked, seeing the hubbub. “In the jazz world,” Mr. Braith replied. The man shook his head and said, “Well, you’re immortalized as far as I’m concerned. ” Another   celebrant, Ian Ma, 15, lives in Sheepshead Bay, a waterfront neighborhood in southern Brooklyn that is nowhere near the new subway line. But he has been enchanted by trains since he started rolling toy models on the floor as a child, he said, and he cajoled his parents into giving him a ride. “I feel like I’ve been waiting for this train my whole life,” he said, seemingly speaking for many others.",

    "text": "MUMBAI, India  —   It was a bold and risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that quickly seemed to backfire. The announcement of a ban on the largest currency bills circulating in India, which came into full effect at midnight Friday, the last day for depositing the old notes at banks, set off cash shortages that have hit the country’s most vulnerable people hard and prompted worries about the economy. But despite those concerns, as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do, for the moment, at least, Mr. Modi’s bet appears to be paying off in the public arena. Even as the poorest Indians have struggled, many have continued to voice support for the prime minister’s initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money, known as “black money,” flowing through the country’s economy, in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption. Mr. Modi, analysts say, has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government. “Even though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family, I support what Mr. Modi is doing for our country,” said Hem Raj Chechi, 39, a taxi driver in New Delhi, the capital, who said business had been down 50 percent since the ban was announced. Mr. Chechi has not been able to pay his children’s school fees or send money back to his village to support them for nearly two months. But, he said, “We need to fight black money, even though it is hurting little people like me. ” Mr. Modi came to power as a disruptive force pledging to overturn the status quo in New Delhi, bring jobs and fight corruption. Indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption, widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless. Declaring war on corruption, Mr. Modi announced on Nov. 8 that 500 and 1, 000 rupee bills, worth about $8 and $15, would be banned the next morning. With the currency ban, Mr. Modi has managed to convince many disaffected Indians that he is on their side. He has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like Mr. Chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the   good. That frustration with a political and business elite viewed by many as corrupt is what drove many Americans to vote for   Donald J. Trump last year, said Eswar S. Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University who is a native of India. “Trump made the case that only he could effect change by blowing up the system,” Mr. Prasad said in an interview. “Modi, in the same way, did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins can’t tackle   problems like corruption. We needed big and painful changes, really disruptive ones. ” Mr. Modi appeared on television on New Year’s Eve to tell Indians he understood their pain and urge them to bear with him in the aim of creating a better nation. He compared his cash ban to the freedom struggle led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, a battle of good versus evil. “Today Mahatma Gandhi is not among us, but the path that was truth that he showed us is still most appropriate,” Mr. Modi said, using the honorific for Gandhi. “As we begin the centenary year of the Satyagraha,” he said, referring to Gandhi’s nonviolent resistance movement, “let us recall the Mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness. ” Mr. Modi was presiding over one of the   major economies in the world when he announced the ban on the rupee notes, which made up 86 percent of the money in circulation. “It’s a little bit crazy,” said Geng Xiao, a professor of finance and public policy at the University of Hong Kong. “When I first read the news, I couldn’t even figure out if it was true. ” The government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency  —   more than 250, 000 rupees, or about $3, 670, could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it. Some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless. Whether Mr. Modi’s   move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate. Some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy. But others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption, even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones. And a country short of cash has been unable to spend it, which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term, economists say. People living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard, their diets and livelihoods severely affected. Many in India see Mr. Modi, who has also had success persuading Parliament to clear the way for a unified    tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines, as living up to his promise to be a reformer of India’s ossified and bureaucratic economy. But in the process, he has placed the Indian economy and his political future at risk. Many economists believe that the Indian economy will take at least a   hit because of a dire shortage of cash, and that the future impact is uncertain. If the effects are prolonged, the public support for Modi could wane. “If this move damages the economy, he’s in for a rough ride,” said Harsh Pant, the head of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. Mr. Xiao said that in a system in which the informal sector is substantial, the economy could be expected to experience a shock when so much cash is suddenly taken out. “You need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing,” he said. Mr. Modi was elected by an overwhelming majority in 2014, defeating the government, led by the Indian National Congress party, that had ruled for most of the country’s   life, on the promise of bringing development and jobs and reducing corruption. “In 2014, he had presented himself as the big disrupter,” Mr. Pant said. “He was the precursor to what’s happening in the West. ” Mr. Modi was then the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, where he had a reputation for tearing away the country’s red tape so businesses could set up shop and expand. But during his first two years after winning national election, Mr. Modi, whose party did not control the upper house of Parliament, struggled to achieve a significant economic overhaul. Mr. Modi changed the political narrative in 2016 as he successfully fought to get Parliament to clear the way for the simplified    tax. He cast the opposition as “people who don’t want change, who don’t want reform,” Mr. Pant said, forcing them in August to support the changes. But the challenges facing Mr. Modi remain considerable. Seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place, the currency shortage remains acute, leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings, many providers said. Nagender Tiwari, 42, a rickshaw driver in East Delhi, said he was earning only 60 percent of the 1, 000 rupees, or about $15, that he used to take home daily before the cash ban. As a result, his family, which includes two children in 11th grade, has reduced its consumption of fish and meat. They have been unable to pay the rent on their home, he said. He said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption, noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes. “So if bribery is not stopped, how can black money be stopped?” he asked. Raj Kumar Bindal, 65, a paper trader in New Delhi, said sales that plummeted to nearly nothing in the days after the cash ban had returned to about half of what they were before. “We can’t shift to a cashless mode overnight,” he said. Surjit Bhalla, a New   economic adviser for the Observatory Group in New York, said he believed Mr. Modi was likely to enact several other major changes in the coming months, possibly including a move to a simplified personal income tax. India needs to reduce the incentives for taxpayers to cheat, Mr. Bhalla said. In the United States, for every $100 collected in income tax, an estimated $20 owed is not paid, he added. In India, for that same $100 in taxes paid, $200 more is owed, he said. Collectively, the cash ban and other anticorruption initiatives have the potential to transform India, Mr. Pant and others said. But doing so depends on Mr. Modi’s continuing to command the political narrative of the country, as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban. “So far, he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him,” Mr. Pant said. “He thinks he can continue to do it, but we really don’t know. There are so many unknowns. ”",

    "text": "BAGHDAD  —   A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market, killing at least 36 people hours after President François Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded. During a news conference with Mr. Hollande, Haider   Iraq’s prime minister, said the suicide bomber had pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers. Once the workers gathered around, he detonated the vehicle. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group. It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad, underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year, including in and around the northern city of Mosul. The attack took place in Sadr City, a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003   invasion. Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada   were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit, vegetables and laborers’ shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire. Asaad Hashim, 28, an owner of a nearby cellphone store, described how the laborers had pushed and shoved around the bomber’s vehicle, trying to get hired. “Then a big boom came, sending them up into the air,” said Mr. Hashim, who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed “the most ineffective security forces in the world” for failing to prevent the attack. An angry crowd cursed the government, even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them. Late last month, the Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad in a bid to ease traffic for the capital’s six million residents. “We have no idea who will kill at any moment and who’s supposed to protect us,” said Ali Abbas, a    father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast. “If the securities forces can’t protect us, then allow us to do the job. ” Several smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed at least 20 civilians and wounded at least 70, according to medics and police officials. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. The United States State Department condemned the attacks. Separately, the American military announced on Monday the death of a coalition service member in Iraq in a “  incident,” without providing further details. Mr. Hollande met with Mr. Abadi and President Fuad Masum, and later traveled to the   northern Kurdish region to meet with French troops and local officials. He pledged to help displaced Iraqis return to Mosul, where Iraqi forces are waging a large offensive against the Islamic State. France is part of the   coalition formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State after the extremist group seized large areas in Iraq and neighboring Syria. France has suffered multiple attacks claimed by the extremist group.",

    "text": "SYDNEY, Australia  —   The annual beach pilgrimage during the height of summer in Melbourne, Australia’s   city, is threatened by an unsettling phenomenon: shores where the tides are tainted with excrement. The Environment Protection Authority in the state of Victoria said on Monday that heavy rains had caused fecal pollution to wash into Port Phillip from rivers, creeks and drains. It advised against swimming at 21 beaches because of poor water quality. “It’s poo in all its luxurious forms that is causing the problem,” said Anthony Boxshall, the agency’s manager of applied sciences, noting that the waste was coming from people, dogs, horses, cows, birds and other animals. Fecal pollution can cause serious health problems, including gastroenteritis. Mr. Boxshall said much of the waste had been washed down the   Yarra River that runs through Melbourne into Port Phillip, affecting the city’s bayside beaches the most. The agency, which takes regular water samples, rates beaches. A “good” rating means that the water is suitable for swimming. “Fair” means that rainfall has affected the water. “Poor” means people should avoid it. Residents said that the pollution had deterred them from indulging in a favorite summer ritual. “When the temperature gets above 86 Fahrenheit, Melbournians typically pack the family in the car with food and drink and spend the day at the beach,” said Sam Riley, who lives in the city. “I was going to take my two young boys to the beach myself over the summer, but now I’m concerned about whether the water is clean. ” Mr. Boxshall said any improvement in the beaches’ water quality was uncertain as long as the rain continued. The agency says it usually takes between 24 and 48 hours for the waters to clear after the rain stops.",

    "text": "When the Green Bay Packers lost to the Washington Redskins in Week 11, dropping to   Aaron Rodgers vowed to “run the table” in a march to the playoffs. With a   victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night, the team fulfilled Rodgers’ promise. Much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the Redskins lost to the Giants, thus guaranteeing both the Packers and Lions would be playoff teams, but the N. F. C. North bragging rights, and a home game in the first round of the playoffs, were sufficient motivation for Green Bay to push hard enough to secure the team’s sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for Detroit. Pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams. But when all was said and done, ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order. No. 6 Detroit Lions at No. 3 Seattle Seahawks Time: 8:15 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on NBC The Seahawks’ title hopes took a crushing blow when Earl Thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg. After the injury, the Seahawks went   with the wins coming with major asterisks as they came against the   Rams and 49ers. That collapse paled in comparison to the Lions, who lost their final three games, blowing what had been a large division lead against Green Bay. Line: Seahawks   ( : 43) No. 5 Giants at No. 4 Green Bay Packers Time: 4:40 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on Fox Thanks to playing in the N. F. C. East, home of the   Dallas Cowboys, the Giants managed to tie Atlanta for the   record in the N. F. C. but got stuck with the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and a road game against a   Packers squad that won its final six games. The good news for the Giants is that superstitious fans will note that the last two times they played the Packers on the road in the playoffs, they not only won the games but went on to win the Super Bowl both times. Line: Packers   ( : 44. 5) Bye weeks: Dallas, Atlanta No. 5 Oakland Raiders at No. 4 Houston Texans Time: 4:35 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on ESPN Line: Texans   ( : 37) The Texans were the least inspiring of the N. F. L. ’s division champions and that was complicated further when Tom Savage, whom the team had elevated to starting quarterback after the benching of Brock Osweiler, was forced to leave Week 17’s loss to Tennessee with a concussion. As bad as that sounds, it may still be enough against a reeling Oakland squad that lost Derek Carr to a broken leg in Week 16, Matt McGloin to a shoulder injury in Week 17, and fell all the way from the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. to No. 5. It is unclear at this point if McGloin or rookie Connor Cook will start at quarterback against Houston. No. 6 Miami Dolphins at No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers Time: 1:05 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on CBS The Dolphins were a contender when the team’s quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, was lost in Week 14 with injured ligaments in his left knee. Thanks to backup quarterback Matt Moore, and Jay Ajayi, the team’s   running back, they won two of three games and secured a   berth. But going up against a   offense like Pittsburgh is a tough test for Miami’s middling defense, even if Tannehill’s knee heals enough to allow him to return. Line: Steelers  .5 ( : 47. 5) Bye weeks: New England, Kansas City With four teams vying for two N. F. C. playoff spots, all eyes were on the   game on Sunday. A Redskins victory could have caused movement in the seedings, with the Lions and Packers playing a     evening matchup. The Giants, who had already locked up the No. 5 seed and had nothing to gain, threw a wrench in the Redskins’ plans, eliminating their division rivals with a decisive   victory. With the drama essentially taken out of the N. F. C. all of the playoff movement Sunday occurred in the A. F. C. where there was a   at the top of the standings in the A. F. C. West. Just a week after losing Derek Carr, the team’s quarterback and a legitimate candidate for most valuable player, to a broken leg, the Oakland Raiders were crushed   by the Denver Broncos. That, combined with the Kansas City Chiefs’   victory over the San Diego Chargers vaulted the Chiefs from a   spot all the way to the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. which comes with a   bye in the playoffs. The loss for Oakland added to the misery of the Raiders, who have gone from Super Bowl contenders last week to a   team that will play on the road in Houston next week potentially with a   quarterback under center as Carr’s backup, Matt McGloin, injured his shoulder in the loss to the Broncos. Beyond the switch to the Chiefs as the No.   in the A. F. C. it was business as usual for the teams that will get bye weeks in the playoffs. The New England Patriots secured the No. 1 spot in the A. F. C. with a win over Miami, the Dallas Cowboys were already guaranteed the No. 1 spot in the N. F. C. before their loss to Philadelphia, and the Atlanta Falcons held onto the No. 2 seed in the N. F. C. with a   win over New Orleans. The only remaining chance for a minor   was for the Packers, who led their division by virtue of a tiebreaker, to lose to the Lions, which would have forced them to play on the road in the   round of the playoffs. But the    aspect of the de facto N. F. C. North championship went away when the Redskins lost to the Giants, which eliminated the Redskins from   contention. While most of the races were straight forward, one of the crazier playoff scenarios that had been discussed before the week was the possibility that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could find themselves in the playoffs. They simply had to shoot the moon by beating the Carolina Panthers, having the Redskins tie the Giants, the Packers lose to the Lions, and should all of that happen they simply required wins by Indianapolis, Dallas, Tennessee and San Francisco to top the Packers in strength of schedule. Tampa Bay took care of their end by beating the Panthers early in the day, but they were eliminated officially when Dallas lost to Philadelphia.",

    "text": "Mariah Carey suffered through a performance train wreck in Times Square on New Year’s Eve as malfunctions left her at a loss vocally during her hit song “Emotions,” struggling to reach notes and to sync the lyrics and music. The trouble continued when she gave up on another of her   numbers, “We Belong Together,” while a recording of the song continued to play, a confirmation that she had been  . But on Sunday, a dispute erupted between Ms. Carey’s representatives and producers of ABC’s “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest,” on which the singer was performing. Ms. Carey’s manager, Stella Bulochnikov, charged that the show’s producers had been aware of technical problems but did not fix them  —   and chose to continue showing Ms. Carey’s messy performance “to get ratings. ” “I will never know the truth, but I do know that we told them three times that her mike pack was not working and it was a disastrous production,” Ms. Bulochnikov told Us Weekly magazine on Sunday. “I’m certainly not calling the F. B. I. to investigate. It is what it is: New Year’s Eve in Times Square. Mariah did them a favor. She was the biggest star there, and they did not have their” act together. Dick Clark Productions, which produced the show, issued a statement on Sunday night saying that Ms. Carey’s performance woes had nothing to do with the production, and that any suggestion that the company “would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd. ” “In very rare instances, there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television,” the statement said, adding that an initial investigation suggested that the production company “had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey’s New Year’s Eve performance. ” A veteran audio producer, Robert Goldstein of Maryland Sound International, a company that has worked on the Times Square event for years, also said in an email that there had been no malfunctions with the sound equipment he oversaw. “Every monitor and   device worked perfectly,” Mr. Goldstein said. “ I can’t comment beyond that and don’t know what her nontechnical issue may have been. ” A spokeswoman for Ms. Carey said on Sunday that the singer was not at fault for her performance. “Unfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances,” the spokeswoman, Nicole Perna, told The Associated Press. It was a rare meltdown on national television by one of the   recording artists of all time. Ms. Carey, a pop phenomenon in the 1990s who won five Grammys out of 34 nominations over the years, was the final   act on ABC’s “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest. ” She had just finished “Auld Lang Syne” when her star turn began to spiral out of control. “We can’t hear,” she said in the opening seconds of “Emotions” after she sashayed down the stage before more than one million people who had gathered to watch the ball drop in Manhattan. Standing still with her left hand on her hip while music played, Ms. Carey told the audience that there had not been a proper sound check before her performance. Then she said, “We’ll just sing,” and noted proudly of her song, “It went to No. 1. ” But she could not manage the notes that followed, and she either forgot lyrics or did not want to deliver a subpar performance. “We’re missing some of these vocals, but it is what it is,” she said. “Let the audience sing. ” ABC quickly cut to shots of the Times Square crowd as Ms. Carey tried to perform some of her choreography. She continued suggesting fixes from the stage, and at one point seemed to defend herself. “I’m trying to be a good sport here,” she said. When the number ended, the crowd cheered her on. “That was  —   ” she said, pausing for effect, “amazing. ” She seemed to recover at first with “We Belong Together,” but there appeared to be another malfunction, and Ms. Carey again stopped singing. But this time, the prerecorded number kept playing. “It just don’t get any better,” she said, and then left the stage. The cause of the problem was not immediately clear. After the performance, Ms. Carey posted a mildly profane slang phrase on Twitter with an “upset” emoji, then wrote: “Have a happy and healthy new year everybody! Here’s to making more headlines in 2017. ” An ABC spokesman said on Sunday that the network would not comment on the problems with Ms. Carey’s performance.",

    "text": "PARIS  —   When the Islamic State was about to be driven out of the ancient city of Palmyra in March, Yves Ubelmann got a call from Syria’s director of antiquities to come over in a hurry. An architect by training, Mr. Ubelmann, 36, had worked in Syria before the country was engulfed by war. But now there was special urgency for the kind of work his youthful team of architects, mathematicians and designers did from their cramped offices in Paris: producing digital copies of threatened historical sites. Palmyra, parts of it already destroyed by the Islamists who deemed these monuments idolatrous, was still rigged with explosives. So he and Houmam Saad, his Syrian colleague, spent four days flying a drone with a robot camera over the crumbled arches and temples. “Drones with four or six rotors can hover really close and register structural details, every crack and hole, and we can take very precise measurements,” said Mr. Ubelmann, who founded the company Iconem. “This is the stuff architects and archaeologists need. ” They need it in a new push for virtual preservation that scientists, archaeologists and others, like Mr. Ubelmann, are compiling on a large scale. The records could be used to create computer models that would show how monuments and endangered historical sites might one day be restored, repaired or reconstructed. Of special interest today are ancient sites in Syria, and also Iraq, that have suffered from war, looting and the Islamic State. “Palmyra was very difficult,” Mr. Ubelmann said. “The terrorists were uploading videos with them blowing up monuments and smashing statues to manipulate public opinion,” he said. “We felt the best response was to magnify the pictures of these places and show their splendor and their importance to the culture. It became a war of images. ” The latest front in that war is in the exhibition halls of the Grand Palais in Paris, where, through Jan. 9, many of the 40, 000 images he and his team took at Palmyra have become the basis for displays. Called “Eternal Sites: From Bamiyan to Palmyra,” the show aims to draw attention to the rising threats to global heritage. To underscore the exhibition’s political importance, it was opened several weeks ago by President François Hollande of France, who described it as “an act of resistance” against terror and intolerance. Showing the beauty of the Middle Eastern heritage, he said, “is the best answer to the Islamist propaganda of hate, destruction and death. ”   Martinez, the director of the Louvre and the lead curator of the show, said the sites had been chosen because “all are under threat from pillaging, neglect or destruction and are not accessible to the public. ” He said it aimed to mobilize public opinion “in the face of the devastation of unique heritage. ” Besides images from Palmyra, the multimedia show projects enormous   photographs and videos, immersing visitors in different eras, including the ancient Iraqi city of Khorsabad around 700 B. C. an   mosque in Damascus and a medieval Christian citadel. Mr. Ubelmann dismissed any criticism of collaboration with the government of the Syrian president, Bashar  . “We were working pro bono, not for any government, but to help the archaeologists,” he said. They shared their work with the Syrian archaeologists, he said, adding, “We also train our colleagues so they can later do this on their own. ” What is paramount is memory and potential restoration. In the last year, his team has flown drones over some 20 historic sites in Syria. Recently, it moved into   zones in Iraq, close to the front line in the fight against the Islamic State. The team is now analyzing the war’s effects on the remains of once thriving cities dating back some 3, 000 years, including Nineveh, Khorsabad and the thrashed temple and palace of Nimrud, where the government drove out the jihadists in November. In 2015, Islamists sent out videos showing militants using sledgehammers to break reliefs of human figures and mythical winged bulls as part of their   campaign. “Nimrud was probably the most splendid of the Assyrian cities,” Layla Abdulkarim, a Syrian architect, said as she analyzed aerial photographs. Using drones in archaeological work is not entirely new, specialists say, but at a recent gathering in Paris researchers from Europe and the Middle East said they were now having to practice “war archaeology,” that is, collecting reliable data from   areas. The images from the drones in war zones had proved immensely valuable. But these were barely scratching the surface. Before the war, close to 150 archaeological projects were underway, just in Syria, researchers said. Experts from many countries are trying to assess the damage in Syria’s old cities but also in the area where the Islamic State held sway that is straddling Iraq and Syria, the region that is seen as central to human history and often called the birthplace of modern economics and writing. There is an outcry for data about the havoc wreaked in Yemen by Saudi bombing. “People are exchanging satellite images and data on blogs and other research platforms, but we have no real assessment yet because so many ancient sites are not accessible,” said Pascal Butterlin, a professor of archaeology at the Sorbonne in Paris. Time is of the essence, even in the case of    ruins, Mr. Butterlin said. He has led expeditions for more than 20 years to Mari, near Syria’s border with Iraq. Before fleeing, the guards at Mari reported that looters had come from Iraq, he said. “We need to know what places need to be stabilized and how looters have altered the sites,” he said. “Important evidence, like clandestine pits, can disappear very quickly through sandstorms and erosion. ” Cheikhmous Ali, a Syrian archaeologist based in France, who founded the international group the Association for the Protection of Syrian Archaeology, said reports of organized pillaging continued. A first wave of looting began in 2012, Mr. Ali said, and looting has accelerated since 2014 with the arrival of the Islamic State. While jihadists were more motivated to destroy the artifacts, they had also allowed looters to operate in exchange for money. Mr. Ali said he kept an ever changing tally of museums bombed, objects carted off, safes stolen. The exhibition in Paris, which is drawing large crowds, coincides with “History Begins in Mesopotamia,” a show at the Louvre’s regional museum in Lens. Both exhibitions highlight the French government’s active concern about cultural damage in Syria, which was briefly controlled by France in the first half of the 20th century. Mr. Hollande has taken a strong interest, condemning the deliberate destruction of patrimony by all sides as “war crimes. ” This past month, France offered $30 million toward a proposed $100 million fund to protect sites as fighting abates, provide emergency storage for artifacts and eventually rehabilitate monuments. At the “Eternal Sites” opening at the Grand Palais, Mr. Hollande stressed that France was taking in more Syrian refugees trying to protect monuments of great historical and cultural importance did not mean ignoring the suffering of the population. “Should we be concerned about the patrimony?” he asked. “What is more important, saving lives or saving stones? In reality, these two are inseparable. ”",

    "text": "WASHINGTON  —   It’s   or   time for Republicans. After a tumultuous decade that has seen profound changes in the makeup and character of their party, Republicans are poised to complete their slow but steady climb back to power as they seize control of the House, Senate and the White House for the first time since 2006. That political triad will leave them with a splendid opportunity for success. But there is little room for failure if they hope to satisfy their impatient constituents and deliver on bold promises to reshape the nation’s health care delivery system, restructure the tax code, drive job creation, muscle up American foreign policy, rebuild a crumbling infrastructure and set America on a new course. Republicans who will take command of the Senate and House as the 115th Congress convenes on Tuesday have long been itching for a chance to do it their way, constantly grousing that President Obama and Congressional Democrats held back American progress and economic growth. Now they must show they can deliver. And they know it. “When you have both houses and the presidency, there is no acceptable excuse for not passing major legislation,” said Representative Tom Cole, a senior Republican from Oklahoma. “There is a lot of pressure on Republican members to produce and to produce quickly. ” That will not be easy. There is a mutual wariness between many Republicans in Congress and   Donald J. Trump, leaving it unclear how often their interests and priorities will coalesce or collide. Some of the biggest fights might well be between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the White House occupied by a man who campaigned against the establishment and some of the very Republicans running Congress. Republicans must also maneuver while facing slightly expanded Democratic minorities in the House and Senate, in a climate that is, in many respects, even more hostile than it was before the November elections. Democrats remain angry at how Republicans treated President Obama, including their refusal to consider the nomination of federal Judge Merrick B. Garland to the United States Supreme Court. Democrats want payback for the cold shoulder given to Mr. Garland’s nomination to satisfy themselves and to show their supporters that they are not going to roll over for the new Republican government. While they cannot employ the filibuster to block most nominations, they still retain it for Supreme Court picks and legislation  —   at least for now. Perhaps most important, Republicans themselves are going to need something of an attitude adjustment. The contemporary Republican Party has been built out of fierce opposition to Mr. Obama and deep disdain for activist government. Nearly   of current House Republicans have never served with a Republican president and their entire time in Washington has been spent fighting the executive branch. As a result, Republicans have had the luxury of being able to argue for positions that appealed to their conservative base but that they knew would not become law because Senate Democrats would block them or because the president would veto them. Now, if they can assemble the votes, their ideas will become law  —   with all the attendant consequences. Republicans who have shied from the responsibility of government will now be called upon to support increases in the debt limit, approve annual budgets, endorse spending bills and back other   measures that they formerly left to the Democrats and some of their more compromising colleagues. With Democrats unlikely to help on many of those votes after being castigated for them by Republicans, the Republicans who belonged to the “vote no, hope yes” caucus when it came to critical legislation in recent years now will have to vote yes and hope things go well. This isn’t the same style of Republican majority pushed from power after being routed in the 2006 midterm elections after the public backlash to the administration of President George W. Bush and his handling of the war in Iraq. Forged by the Tea Party revolt that restored Republicans to control of the House in the 2010 elections, and in the Senate in 2014, this party is much more conservative with a membership that tends to see government as an impediment to be leveled, not as a force to be shaped to their views to the benefit of their constituents. Eight years of railing against the Obama administration has infused them and their constituents with a hostility and disregard for the government that Republicans must now lead rather than ridicule. Tensions could arise between House and Senate Republicans as well. When the Newt   party took over the House in 1995 for the first time in four decades, newly empowered Republicans sent a raft of legislation to the Senate, only to see it stall there. With President Bill Clinton in the White House at the time, Republicans knew much of it would not be enacted. Now, with Mr. Trump soon to occupy the Oval Office, it is unlikely that House Republicans will be willing to watch Democrats bottle up legislation in the Senate. Demands that their Senate counterparts eliminate the filibuster could mount quickly. While they understand the challenges, Republicans are nonetheless jubilant at their enviable position. “A Republican in the White House and a Republican majority in Congress present tremendous opportunity to make real progress,” Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, said in the party’s weekly radio address on Saturday. “We assume that responsibility with the promise that we’ll work hard to do everything that we can to deliver more opportunities to Americans tomorrow than they have today. ” “I am pretty giddy,” said Mr. Cole as he looked ahead. Republicans have won their chance. Now it is time to see what they can do with it.",

    "text": "ISTANBUL  —   The Islamic State on Monday issued a rare claim of responsibility for an attack in Turkey after a New Year’s Day shooting at an Istanbul nightclub that killed at least 39 people, describing the gunman who carried out the assault  —   and who has not been identified or captured  —   as “a hero soldier of the caliphate. ” The Turkish authorities are still searching for the gunman, who killed a police officer guarding the Reina nightclub before going on a shooting rampage with a   rifle, but the state news media reported that eight suspects had been detained in connection with the attack. The authorities on Monday released two photographs of the person suspected of being the gunman, captured by security cameras, that showed a   cleanshaven man in a dark winter coat. The government’s spokesman, Numan Kurtulmus, said at a news conference that investigators believed they found the assailant’s fingerprints and that they were close to identifying him. Mr. Kurtulmus did not mention the Islamic State specifically, but he said Turkey would press the fight against terrorism. Referring to the attack, which happened just after midnight on Sunday morning, Mr. Kurtulmus said: “The fact that it was done during the first minutes of 2017 gives an important message. The message is, ‘We will go on to menace Turkey in 2017.’ And we say to them, we will break into your caves wherever you are. ” The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported on Monday that the gunman might be from Kyrgyzstan or elsewhere in Central Asia. The Russian news agency Interfax quoted Aiymkan Kulukeyeva, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry in Kyrgyzstan, as saying, “According to preliminary information, this information is doubtful, but we are checking all the same. ” The Islamic State asserted in a statement that the attack had been carried out “in continuation of the blessed operations that the Islamic State is conducting against Turkey, the protector of the cross. ” “A hero soldier of the caliphate attacked one of the most famous nightclubs, where Christians celebrated their pagan holiday,” read the statement from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. “They used hand grenades and a machine gun and transformed their celebration to mourning. ” In an apparent reference to Turkey’s role in the conflict in Syria, the statement warned that “the government of Turkey should know that the blood of Muslims, which it is targeting with its planes and its guns, will cause a fire in its home by God’s will. ” The statement did not name the assailant, and it was not clear whether the Islamic State had organized the attack or had merely inspired the gunman. But the shooting came just days after a   State group, the Nashir Media Foundation, published the latest in a series of messages calling for attacks on clubs, markets and movie theaters. The Islamic State’s claim of responsibility came after years of complex relations between the Turkish state and the jihadist group operating across its southern border. Several terrorist attacks in Turkey over the last year have been attributed to the Islamic State, but the militant group rarely claims responsibility for major attacks in the country. A rare exception came in November, when the group claimed to be behind a deadly car bombing in southeastern Turkey. Analysts said that the Islamic State has walked a fine line in Turkey, trying to balance its goal of destabilizing the country without antagonizing the government to the extent that it would crack down heavily. For years, Turkey looked the other way, according to analysts and regional diplomats, as jihadist groups moved fighters and supplies across the border, establishing deep networks in Turkish border towns. Committed to supporting the uprising against President Bashar   of Syria, Turkey felt the jihadists could be managed while they fought with forces loyal to the Syrian government. But that policy ultimately changed, as Turkey worked to secure its borders, under pressure from its allies as it took in millions of Syrian refugees and as terrorist attacks rocked the country. Turkey began a military intervention in northern Syria in August that put its forces on the front lines against Kurdish militants as well as Islamic State fighters. This turned the jihadists decidedly against Turkey, prompting their leaders to call for attacks there. The Turkish military said on Monday that it had struck Islamic State targets in Syria, killing at least 22 militants. American intelligence officials had recently expressed concern about a possible attack in Turkey, warning in a statement on Dec. 22 that extremist groups were “continuing aggressive efforts to conduct attacks throughout Turkey” in areas where American citizens and expatriates lived or visited. That warning came three days after a gunman, described by Turkish officials as a      police officer, assassinated Andrey G. Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, at an art gallery in the capital, Ankara. The gunman shouted “God is great!” and “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!” during the attack, which was captured on video. The   Anadolu news agency said that 38 of the 39 people who died in the attack on Sunday had been identified, The Associated Press reported. At least two dozen of the people killed were said to be foreigners.",

    "text": "JERUSALEM  —   Israeli police investigators questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for three hours at his official residence on Monday evening on suspicion of receiving illicit gifts and favors from business executives. Mr. Netanyahu was questioned “under caution,” the police said in a statement, implying that there were grounds to suspect that Mr. Netanyahu might have committed a criminal offense. “No further details can be given at this stage,” the statement added. The Ministry of Justice said late Monday that Mr. Netanyahu had been questioned by investigators from Lahav 433, a police fraud investigation and prosecution unit, with the authorization of the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit. In a detailed statement, the ministry described how the police had gathered testimony from dozens of witnesses, some abroad, and seized documents during a monthslong graft inquiry. While some aspects of the inquiry did not yield evidence of crimes, the statement said, other parts warranted a deeper investigation. Mr. Netanyahu, who has been subject to police inquiries and investigations in the past that ended without charges, has vehemently denied any impropriety. “This will all come to nothing, because there is nothing,” he has said repeatedly of the latest accusations. Local news outlets say the investigators are focused on two separate cases, one more serious than the other, but they have offered little detail on the more serious one. The less weighty one, according to reports in the newspaper Haaretz and other outlets, concerns favors for Mr. Netanyahu, and possibly for members of his family, given by Israeli and foreign business executives. The Israeli police took testimony from Ronald S. Lauder, a conservative American businessman and philanthropist, and a close friend of Mr. Netanyahu’s, when he came to Israel in late September to attend the funeral of Shimon Peres, the former prime minister and president. Upon Mr. Lauder’s arrival in Israel, he was asked to meet with the Israeli police “and respond to questions related to an investigation, to which Mr. Lauder is not a party,” Helena Beilin, a Tel   lawyer representing Mr. Lauder, said in a statement. “After a short meeting the following day, he was told that his presence was no longer needed and that there would be no need for additional meetings. This remains the case. ” Mr. Netanyahu’s office, suggesting that he is the victim of a witch hunt, issued a statement over the weekend berating the news organizations for what it described as premature and politically motivated reports. “Try to replace the prime minister at the ballot boxes, as is accepted in democracies,” it added. In televised remarks on Monday afternoon, Mr. Netanyahu told legislators from his conservative Likud Party in Parliament, “We hear the celebratory spirit and winds blowing through the television studios and in the corridors of the opposition. ” “Hold off the celebrations don’t rush,” he added. “I’ve told you before and will tell you again  —   this will come to nothing, because there is nothing. ” Mr. Netanyahu is serving his third consecutive term in office, and his fourth over all. He has exuded confidence lately, lashing out at journalists who have been critical of him, talking up Israel’s diplomatic and economic achievements, and calling in the United States ambassador to Israel, Daniel B. Shapiro, for a dressing down late last month after the Obama administration decided not to use its veto to shield Israel from a United Nations Security Council resolution that condemned Israeli settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyahu, generally a popular prime minister, has developed a combative relationship with the local mainstream news media. After years of tension with the Obama administration, he also appears buoyed by the prospect of a partnership with   Donald J. Trump, who seems more sympathetic to Israeli government policies on issues like settlements. For Mr. Netanyahu’s opponents, the prospect of a possible indictment has provided a glimmer of hope, even though elections are not scheduled until late 2019. “This creates an unusual dynamic in Israeli politics,” said Nahum Barnea, a political columnist for the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth and a critic of Mr. Netanyahu. On the one hand, Mr. Barnea said, there were already signs that Netanyahu loyalists would try to promote legislation banning investigations of sitting prime ministers. On the other, he said, the question of who might succeed Mr. Netanyahu, who has no natural heir in his party, was bound to be raised. Opposition leaders were fairly subdued in their initial response. Isaac Herzog, the leader of the Zionist Union and of the opposition in Parliament, said it was “a tough day for Israel when a prime minister is under investigation. ” He added, “We are not expressing satisfaction at another’s misfortune. ” Mr. Herzog has also been the subject of police investigations over campaign funding. Yair Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, which has challenged Likud in recent polls, said, “The presumption of innocence applies to every Israeli, including the prime minister. ” He called for a swift investigation for the sake of the country, saying, “A person who is being investigated is a person under pressure. ” Israeli prime ministers are not obligated to step down while under investigation, unless they are charged with a crime. Nonetheless, the accusations could chip away at Mr. Netanyahu’s standing. His predecessor, Ehud Olmert, was forced from power in 2008 under the weight of police investigations and accusations of corruption, although he remained in office as a caretaker prime minister until early elections could be held in 2009. In February, Mr. Olmert became the first former Israeli prime minister to enter prison. He is serving a   term for bribery and obstruction of justice. Mr. Netanyahu described Mr. Olmert in 2008 as a “prime minister up to his neck in investigations” and said he could not be trusted to make fateful decisions under the circumstances because they might be based on personal rather than national interests. Since the 1990s, Mr. Netanyahu’s political career has been dogged by inquiries into his conduct, and that of people around him, though no charges have been filed against him. The inquiries have ranged from scandals involving travel expenses and garden furniture  —   the Netanyahus were suspected of having switched a new set bought for the prime minister’s official residence with an identical, old set in their private home in Caesarea  —   to a more recent one involving a   deal with Germany for the acquisition of submarines. That agreement came under scrutiny after it became known that Mr. Netanyahu’s personal lawyer also represents the Israeli agent of the German shipyard that builds the submarines, and other naval equipment purchased by Israel, giving rise to suspicion of a conflict of interest. In that episode, too, Mr. Netanyahu and the lawyer, David Shimron, have denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Netanyahu’s relationship with Arnaud Mimran, a French tycoon who was convicted of fraud last year, and who testified that he had contributed a large sum of money to Mr. Netanyahu for his 2009 election campaign, has also prompted suspicions of impropriety.",

    "text": "PARIS  —   If the world does not envy the French enough already for their generous vacations, universal health care and fine food and wine, the arrival of 2017 brings this: a newly created “right to disconnect. ” Though ridiculed in some quarters as a ban on   email after hours, it is not quite that. But it is born of the enlightened view that it is actually beneficial for people not to work all the time, and that workers have the right to occasionally draw the line when their employer’s demands intrude on evenings at home, treasured vacations or Sundays with friends and family. “Employees are more and more connected during hours outside of the office,” Myriam El Khomri, the minister of labor, said last year in justifying the need for the law. “The boundary between professional and personal life has become tenuous,” and cases of burnout are becoming more prevalent, she said. The measure is one of a raft of new laws that took effect with the beginning of the new year and that exemplify the search for compromises between preserving French traditions and making concessions to the realities of the modern world. The new provision in the labor law does not ban   emails, but does require that companies with more than 50 employees negotiate a new protocol to ensure that work does not spill into days off or   hours. Some consultants have recommended that employees and managers avoid the “reply all” function on emails to groups so that only one person is being asked to read an email and respond, rather than half the office. Another approach recommends setting a time each evening after which employees are not expected to reply  —   several firms have designated the 10 hours between 9 p. m. and 7 a. m. others the 12 hours between 7 p. m. and 7 a. m. As a country with Catholic roots, but also a commitment to personal liberties, France has had an ambivalent approach to divorce. It has long been legal, but not necessarily speedy. A new nod to modernity in French laws eases the rules for people who want to divorce. While historically France has been far more flexible than Ireland or Italy, it still required a judge to rule on each divorce. The procedure routinely took as long as a year, and sometimes far longer, because cases were backed up awaiting the judicial signature. Now, if both members of the couple agree on the divorce, lawyers can draw up the divorce agreement, jointly sign the papers and have them notarized. No judges need be involved. Smoking is another area in which French habits have changed relatively little in recent years  —   27 to 28 percent of the population still lights up  —   but the country is now following many others in requiring “neutral packaging” for tobacco products: Instead of advertising a brand, cigarette packs sport only health warnings and photos of illnesses caused by smoking. At least two new laws demonstrate the country’s gradual move toward more sustainable products. Instead of thin plastic bags, French supermarkets and fruit vendors must substitute either bags made with a   synthetic called amidon that is mixed with plastic, a thicker type of plastic bag that could be reused, or paper bags. At Monoprix, a supermarket chain, paper bags have won out and stacks of them perch precariously on stands at the ends of fruit counters. More radical is the edict that went into effect on Sunday banning the use of pesticides in public gardens and along public highways. It promises to make public green spaces safer for birds and other small animals, which are especially vulnerable to the poisons used in pest killers. It will not be easy for the gardeners employed by cities to turn to more sustainable methods. When the city of Lyon abandoned pesticides voluntarily nine years ago, it took quite some time to change the culture, although Lyon is now considered a model. In 2019, the antipesticide law will expand to include amateur gardeners  —   a challenge not only for the French with backyard rows of dahlias and daisies, but also for those who nurse roses in their window boxes. A new   law is sure to please the French because it plays to their immense pride in local comestibles: It allows prepared foods, like frozen dinners, to be labeled “produit d’origine française” only if the item is made with 100 percent French meat or milk. Any product with more than 8 percent foreign meat must say where the animal was born, raised and butchered. A product with more than 50 percent foreign milk must say where it was collected and turned into the product being sold. It seems that the French version of “Made in America” is “Raised in France. ”",

    "text": "OTTAWA  —   It was 7 a. m. and 99 passengers and six crew members were aboard a 737 on the tarmac at Calgary International Airport, bound for a sunny holiday in Cancun, Mexico. There was one problem, however. The flight’s captain was passed out in the cockpit, apparently from drinking. The police in Calgary, Alberta, arrested the pilot, Miroslav Gronych, 37, on Saturday and have charged him with two   offenses. “This is a new one, and obviously this had a very significant potential to cause great harm had the pilot actually been allowed to fly this plane,” Staff Sgt. Paul Stacey of the Calgary Police Service said at a news conference. “There’s just so many checks and balances, it just doesn’t surprise me that he got caught before this plane was able to leave the gate. ” Nevertheless, Inspector Ken Thrower, the commander of the Calgary Police Service’s traffic and airport unit, said his officers, along with airport officials and inspectors from Transport Canada, the aviation regulator, will begin trying to figure out how the pilot managed to pass through several checkpoints, including airport security, while obviously inebriated. Mr. Gronych was charged with two criminal offenses: having care and control of an aircraft while impaired, and having care and control of an aircraft while testing for more than 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. “He was pretty high,” Sergeant Stacey said, adding that it was inconceivable that the pilot had followed Transport Canada regulations that bar drinking or drug use by pilots within eight hours of a flight. The aircraft was operated by Sunwing Airlines, a   carrier based in Toronto. Sunwing’s gate agents found the pilot’s behavior to be unusual and alerted the  . The   then discovered the pilot slumped in the captain’s seat and “severely impaired by alcohol,” Sergeant Stacey said. Transport Canada, which did not respond to requests for comment, is conducting a separate investigation, which is likely to result in additional charges, the police said. Inspector Thrower said Mr. Gronych is from Slovenia and is in Canada on a work visa. He will appear in court again on Thursday. After some delay, the flight did take off with a new crew. Sunwing did not respond to requests for comment. Janine Massey, a spokeswoman, told The Associated Press that the carrier was “very apologetic for any upset that this has caused and would like to assure our customers that safety remains our utmost priority. ”",

    "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO  —   A prison riot involving gangs vying for supremacy over the cocaine trade in the Brazilian Amazon left at least 56 people dead, the authorities in the city of Manaus said on Monday. Riots at Brazil’s prisons are common, but the episode in Manaus, which involved decapitated bodies being thrown over the walls of the penitentiary, ranks among the bloodiest in recent decades. Officials expressed dismay over the scenes of slaughter in the Compaj prison, which held more than 1, 200 inmates, about triple its official capacity. “I never saw anything like this in my life,” Judge Luís Carlos Valois, who helped negotiate an end to the riot, said in a Facebook post. He said that dozens of people had been killed, but that it was challenging to arrive at a precise count: “There were lots of bodies. Many of them were dismembered. ” The riot flared on Sunday and lasted about 17 hours, raising fears of even greater violence on the streets of Manaus, the largest city in the Amazon basin with a population of about 2. 1 million. Manaus has emerged as a brutal battleground between two prison gangs that are contesting control of the drug trade in the region. The authorities said that one of the gangs, Familia do Norte (Family of the North) which operates from the Manaus prisons, was responsible for the vast majority of the killings during the riot. The targets were from First Capital Command, a much larger rival gang commonly known by its Portuguese initials, P. C. C. which has its roots in the prisons of São Paulo in southeast Brazil. “There were deaths only on one side,” Sérgio Fontes, the top security official in Amazonas State, told reporters. “The Familia do Norte massacred members of the First Capital Command, and one or another guys who weren’t on their good side at the moment. ” The riot drew comparisons with the 1992 uprising at the Carandiru prison in São Paulo, when police forces stormed the building and 111 inmates were killed. An appeals court recently voided the convictions of 73 police officers for their participation in the killings, raising criticism from human rights groups. Since that episode, the Brazilian authorities have vowed to alleviate overcrowding in the country’s prisons and combat prison gangs. But soaring numbers of convictions for relatively minor drug offenses have pushed prison populations upward, the gangs’ clout is growing, and riots continue to erupt frequently all over the country. In the riot in Manaus, inmates took dozens of fellow prisoners hostage. They also seized 12 employees of Umanizzare, a private contractor that operates prisons in the Amazon. Negotiators eventually won the release of the hostages by assuring the inmates that they would not be harmed or transferred to other prisons. Security specialists say that Brazil could experience more riots like the one in Manaus as P. C. C. the São Paulo gang, extends its reach around the country. Familia do Norte, the Manaus gang, recently formed an alliance with Red Command, a gang that has been losing ground to P. C. C. in parts of Rio de Janeiro.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON  —   It was supposed to be a triumphant morning for Republicans on Capitol Hill  —   a moment to demonstrate the merits of unified party rule in the age of Donald J. Trump. By noon, party leaders had a message for their charges: It was not going smoothly. The day after House Republicans voted to eliminate an independent ethics body, members returned to work on Tuesday to find their offices inundated with angry missives from constituents amid a national uproar. By midmorning, Mr. Trump had weighed in, questioning the members’ priorities on Twitter. Shortly after, lawmakers were summoned to the basement of the Capitol for a hastily convened meeting with Republican leaders. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader  —   who, along with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, had opposed the proposal  —   lobbed a pointed question at his fellow Republicans, according to two people present: Had they campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act, or tinkering with an ethics office? Minutes later, members emerged to say the changes had been scrapped. The reversal came less than 24 hours after House Republicans, meeting in a secret session, voted to curtail the powers of the Office of Congressional Ethics, an independent body created in 2008 after a series of scandals involving House lawmakers, including three who were sent to jail. It was part of a turbulent opening for the Trump era in Washington, marked by a Republican push in the Senate to repeal the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans, led by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, had sought on Monday to prevent the office from pursuing investigations that might result in criminal charges. Instead, they wanted to allow lawmakers on the more powerful House Ethics Committee to shut down inquiries. They even sought to block the small staff at the Office of Congressional Ethics, which would have been renamed and put under the oversight of House lawmakers, from speaking to the news media. “It has damaged or destroyed a lot of political careers in this place, and it’s cost members of Congress millions of dollars to defend themselves against anonymous allegations,” Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, said Tuesday, still defending the move. But such resolve crumbled Tuesday morning, as thousands of phone calls flooded lawmakers’ offices and both conservative and liberal ethics groups issued statements condemning the vote. Some Republicans joined in, saying the measure sent the wrong message to the public. (Internet searches for the words “Who is my representative” surged after news of the plan broke Monday night and peaked Tuesday morning, according to Google.) “It was a stumble,” said Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina, who opposed the measure and who was himself the subject of an ethics investigation while he was governor of South Carolina. “Probably not the way you want to start out. ” Mr. Trump had weighed in via a series of Twitter posts, suggesting that the House should be focused on domestic policy priorities such as health care and a tax overhaul. He called the Office of Congressional Ethics “unfair” but said focusing on it now was a case of misplaced priorities. He appended the hashtag “DTS,” an apparent allusion to his promise to “drain the swamp” in Washington. Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy had made clear on Monday that they, too, were opposed to the change. But amid boxes of pizza at a House office building, with the Rose Bowl playing on a nearby television, several members voiced support for the maneuver, including Representative Steve Pearce of New Mexico, whose office employed an aide who was ensnared in an ethics inquiry but later cleared. At first, on Tuesday morning, Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy played down the changes. Mr. McCarthy suggested that he and Mr. Ryan did not have the power to simply order other Republicans to take their advice. “Welcome back,” he joked, referring to the start of the new session of Congress on Tuesday. Even at home, he said, “I usually don’t win what we watch on TV. ” About an hour later, before new members of Congress were to be sworn in  —   the point when the House adopts new rules that will govern how it conducts itself during the   session  —   Mr. McCarthy told his fellow Republicans that they needed to reverse themselves quickly, or potentially face an even more embarrassing revolt on the House floor. By his estimation, he told them, the provision was going to be removed one way or another. This was not the first time that House lawmakers  —   Democrats or Republicans  —   had tried to curtail the powers or budget of the Office of Congressional Ethics, which some lawmakers see as being too aggressive in its investigations, even though it is routinely cheered by nonprofit ethics groups on both the left and the right. Perhaps most prominently, in 2011, Representative Melvin Watt, a North Carolina Democrat who later left Congress to join the Obama administration, tried to cut the agency’s budget by 40 percent, a proposal that failed on a   vote. The House Ethics Committee, the only body that has the power to actually punish lawmakers, also frequently clashed with the office, which serves more as a grand jury that investigates allegations and issues findings to the Ethics Committee of probable cause of misdeeds. For example, the committee tried in 2015 to force the Office of Congressional Ethics to shut down its investigation into allegations that nine House lawmakers’ trips to Azerbaijan in 2013 had been improperly paid for, in part, by a foreign government entity. Some of the lawmakers also accepted improper gifts during the trips, including rugs and crystal. The Office of Congressional Ethics refused to shut down its inquiry, and it published its findings on its own after the Ethics Committee voted to clear the lawmakers of wrongdoing (although the committee urged them to return the gifts). House rules require the Ethics Committee to act on recommendations by the Office of Congressional Ethics within 90 days, with the expectation that it will either formally clear the targeted lawmakers or create investigative committees to determine if rules or laws have been violated. But in recent years, the committee has increasingly relied on a loophole that allows it to informally continue to review allegations without closing a case, a step it has taken in 21 of the 68 cases referred since 2009. Most frequently, that means an end to the matter, at least as far as the public is aware, even though the Ethics Committee never formally announces that it has closed the investigation. As of this week, cases in such a limbo include allegations against Representatives Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina Roger Williams, Republican of Texas Markwayne Mullin, Republican of Oklahoma Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington Bobby L. Rush, Democrat of Illinois and Luis V. Gutiérrez, Democrat of Illinois. After their reversal on Tuesday, House Republicans agreed to ask the Ethics Committee to examine the Office of Congressional Ethics and recommend possible changes by this summer to address the concerns that some members have raised. Mr. Goodlatte, who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, defended his proposal and called the reporting about it inaccurate. “Gross misrepresentation by opponents of my amendment, and the media willing to go along with this agenda, resulted in a flurry of misconceptions and unfounded claims about the true purpose of this amendment,” he said in a statement. But Mr. Goodlatte’s critics said he had simply been caught trying to sneak through a favor to help protect his fellow lawmakers. “We’re glad that the House Republicans listened to the public outrage about this proposal and came to their senses to reverse it, and not end real ethics enforcement in Congress,” Noah Bookbinder, executive director of the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said.",

    "text": "TMZ, headed by former lawyer Harvey Levin, has always excelled at exploiting legal documents to their advantage: They have a crew of   document scanners camped out at the Los Angeles Courthouse, combing through all manner of filings in order to find the bankruptcy rulings, arrest warrants, and divorce filings before any other site. Which, one can assume, is precisely how, on September 20, they broke the news that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, her husband of two years and partner since 2005. “Brangelina” first decimated the gossip landscape 12 years ago, going on to become the most powerful celebrity narrative in decades. But since then, their narrative has shifted from scandal to domesticity: Jolie has slowly negotiated a path away from traditional stardom, trading action movies for writing and directing, glam cover shoots for dressed down photo ops promoting the myriad humanitarian causes she’s supported for over a decade. At the same time, Pitt, like so many aging handsome stars before him, has secured a spot as one of the most valued players in Hollywood: a prestige player and producer who can still draw people of all ages into the theater, the guy who can still clean up and sell the shit out of a magazine cover. They starred in 2015’s By the Sea, a film, based on the life of her mother, that Jolie wrote and directed. It bombed, but they seemed unfazed, as if it were their home movie, not a project worth millions. In May 2016, Jolie was appointed a visiting professor at the London School of Economics for years, she’s suggested she’ll soon quit acting altogether. Perhaps this was what a contemporary power marriage looked like: growing and expanding your interests, as a pair and apart. Which is part of why news of the divorce came as a shock: There was little indication of trouble in the singular,   world the family had built for themselves. As the tide of the divorce news swept over the internet, rumors of Pitt’s infidelity began to dominate Google search results: He’s been sleeping with Allied   Marion Cotillard he’s getting back together with Gwyneth Jennifer Aniston is filing for divorce! Through the haze of gossip, however, Jolie’s control of the narrative came into focus: It was she, not Pitt, who filed for divorce, seeking physical custody of the children. It was she who hired power divorce attorney Laura Wasser, known for negotiating the divorces of Johnny Depp, Gwen Stefani, and Britney Spears  —   a woman who, as Lainey Gossip points out, has worked in close collaboration with TMZ in the past. And she had attorney Robert Offer make the first statement about the divorce in the New York Times, explaining “the decision was made for the health of the family. ” Jolie’s the one who filed now, in late September, just as Pitt is about to gear up for an Oscar campaign for Allied. She understood, having navigated several Oscar campaigns herself, that Pitt would want to put any hint of scandal quickly to rest and without fanfare. She “allowed” the news to be discovered via legal documents instead of breaking it through a publicist or People magazine, effectively creating a gossip vacuum into which all manner of speculation could build, including a rash of revealed blind items pointing to drug abuse and visits from strippers. Pitt, from this point forward, is on defense  —   and always has been in the case of Jolie’s career. Because Jolie, if anything, has always been the primary architect of the way others view her. It’s almost quaint, in hindsight, to think about how thoroughly Brangelina dominated the world of gossip in the   to and aftermath of their relationship. When rumors of a relationship first began to percolate in 2004, Pitt was still married to America’s Sweetheart Jennifer Aniston, and their    life, depicted to great effect on the cover of People, was figured as the nation’s ideal relationship. Angelina Jolie, she of Tomb Raider and skintight leather costumes, she of the voluptuous breasts, of the troubled girl in Girl, Interrupted and Gia, was just coming off a marriage with Billy Bob Thornton, made famous by the vial of his blood Jolie wore on the red carpet. She had tattoos, so very many of them. She’d just adopted a young boy from Cambodia. She told Vanity Fair that she had “two lovers” with whom she had sex in hotel rooms because that’s what you do when you’re a single mom  —   and that she was bisexual. And then she was starring with Pitt in the 2005 film Mr. and Mrs. Smith, playing rival assassins who spend a lot of time trying to kill each other and having hot sex. Rumors of a relationship swirled, as they do every time two good looking   have sex scenes together. But then, in January 2005, Pitt filed for divorce from Aniston. In May, he was “caught” playing on a Kenyan beach with Jolie and her newly adopted daughter, Zahara in June, the pair appeared in a sprawling, highly suggestive W Magazine spread that figured them as unhappy suburban parents to a brood of  . Mr. and Mrs. Smith opened to a $50 million weekend  —   a personal best for both stars, fueled, in no small part, by the gossip frenzy that had become the constant backdrop of their lives, even as both refused to confirm the existence of a relationship. There was the spurned good girl   the sultry   and the handsome boy in between  —   who, if narratives were to be believed, simply wanted a family. And that was something Aniston supposedly refused to provide, and that Jolie wanted in Benetton ad abundance. In hindsight, there were two very clear ideological strains in conflict: To be “Team Aniston” was to root for the scorned woman, but also for a traditional understanding of what contemporary femininity should look like. Aniston had a Pilates body, hair that always looked the same and samely great, a steady tan, a pert nose, and a great smile. She was a television star, but more significantly, the star of Friends, one of the most popular and inoffensive shows of the late ’90s and early ’00s. People call her “the girl next door,” but she was the hot, popular girl next door from the suburbs: a B student who liked to drink wine with her friends at book club, a big fan of   resorts in Mexico, who never took any fashion risks but looked hot in an LBD. Her image was, as we would say now, a bit basic. And America loved her for it, because basicness is at the heart of the true American ideal. Which is why it seemed so offensive that Brad Pitt would reject her for someone who was the very opposite of basic: Jolie, whose mother was a documentarian and whose father was an asshole film star, who had a weird relationship with her brother that people gossiped about, who got married too young and desecrated her body and studied, briefly, to become a funeral director. She talked about having an eating disorder instead of just calling it “a diet” she said she was “fascinated” by heroin. She seemed legitimately dangerous. People felt about Jolie the way they feel about people from Manhattan with expensive haircuts who wear black all the time, or goths who are really into beat poetry: specters, only barely based in reality, that represent the cultural elite and, as such, a general threat to the status quo. And then there was this secondary strain of Jolie’s image, just emerging at the time of the affair with Pitt: that of Saint Angelina. In 2001, she had been named a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 2002, she adopted a child by herself she traveled the world. She was cosmopolitan her family was an avatar of multiculturalism she was no   heroine. Jolie’s image presented a markedly different vision of “having it all” than Aniston’s  —   and Pitt, the most universally desirable man of modern times, had rejected one of those visions for the other. The ideological blowback wasn’t just intense it was  . 2005 was a pivotal year for the gossip industry, as the upstart gossip blogs and the newly expansive digital paparazzi threw what had to that point been a fairly staid industry into conflict. Us Weekly, People, and OK Magazine had escalating bidding wars for exclusive rights to photos, while Perez Hilton, Just Jared, Pink Is the New Blog, The Defamer, and Oh No They Didn’t either stole photos or undercut their intended significance online. Think: crazed paparazzi forcing Reese Witherspoon and Lindsay Lohan off the road, crotch shots of Britney, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes posing at the Eiffel Tower  —   and Brangelina and their growing family. Part of the obsession was cultural, but part of it was fueled by the sheer amount of images and outlets exploiting that obsession. And in the age before celebrity social media, there was no way, save the Vanity Fair profile, for a celebrity to authoritatively control or negate the proliferating voices attempting to “speak” the meaning of an event, a photo, or soundbite. But Jolie had savvy and understood the power of the image. Instead of addressing the scandal   she simply changed the conversation to human rights, the suffering of refugees, the need for education for young girls. And she did so in a distinctly   way: in press photos, in speeches that had nothing to do with her own love life, in trips to areas of the world stricken by tragedy. She stymied the publicity by dressing her children in the same clothes for multiple days, thus driving down the price of photos. She ran a perfect publicity game by seeming like she wasn’t playing one at all. That’s one way people began to come over, as it were, to Team Jolie. She and Pitt had a biological child  —   who, it’s important to note, was crucially adorable  —   adopted another child, and gave birth to twins. The narrative around Aniston began to sour, her publicity maneuvering of various boyfriends too transparent, her advertising campaigns for bottled water too gauche, her boyfriend too much the type of guy who wears a leather jacket. There were whispers that, despite her insistence otherwise, maybe she didn’t actually want children  —   a stark contrast to Jolie and Pitt’s seemingly   family. They promised not to get married until everyone (read: gay people) could get married, and mildly went back on that promise when it became clear that it mattered to their children. Increasingly, Jolie’s vision of     felt less disruptive, more desirable. She seemed to have softened. She wasn’t playing minxes anymore. She was into directing she had a double mastectomy, and wielded what could have been spun as the end of her sexual potency into a narrative of cancer awareness. She had no publicist and rarely wore makeup, which combined to make her seem even more authentic, even less manipulative. For years, a photo of Brangelina’s   airport arrivals would win a spot in the prime real estate of the gossip magazine’s first few pages, but they’ve slowly faded from prominence: In June, there were rumors that Jolie was considering a run for public office, but they gained little traction. Neither Pitt nor Jolie have social media accounts, which makes it all the more difficult to provide a steady stream of dynamic information about their lives, as has become the norm for gossip coverage. Earlier this month, a halfhearted People magazine post was headlined “Angelina Jolie Buys an   Teddy Bear Off the Side of the Street. ” Which is part of why the news of the divorce arrived as such a shock. Brangelina were the Hollywood couple, the pinnacle of glamour, of otherworldliness: Even if they went to Chuck E. Cheese’s when they visited Pitt’s parents in Missouri, they were ultimately, definitively nothing like us. The makeup of their family, the way they traveled, the way they understood the world, the way they looked when they stood together on the red carpet and made eyes at each other at the table at the Golden Globes, the way they suggested a vigorous intellectual curiosity and a dedication to humanitarianism and really good and sustaining sex, or how they made it seem like art film and blockbuster Hollywood could, indeed,    —   that’s why they mattered. It’s natural to compare the love triangle around Aniston, Pitt, and Jolie to that of Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher, and Elizabeth Taylor back in the 1950s: Then, as now, each of the women came to represent a different understanding of femininity then, as now, the guy in the center was figured as a man with agency, subject to the whims and failings of the women who surrounded him. But when Taylor “won” Fisher, that relationship also disintegrated: He was a nothingburger, clearly just a rebound on Taylor’s road to the tumultuous love affair with Richard Burton that would define the second half of her life, spark the beginning of the paparazzi press as we know it, and completely alter the gossip industry. Taylor and Burton were all glamour, all the time, fire and ice, white diamonds and spilled martinis. They were incendiary onscreen, impossible to look away from, and the proof, amid the crumbling walls of the Hollywood film industry of the ’60s and ’70s, that something like a real movie star still existed. No matter that they couldn’t bring people to the theaters: They still dominated the public imagination, and the understanding of the outer ranges of human capability, like the greatest stars of the golden age. That was what Brangelina promised  —   and now, as the story breaks on TMZ, the apotheosis of the digital publicity age they both helped create and then systematically ignored, it can’t help but feel like the end of an era. In the hours since news of the divorce first broke, rumors of an affair  —   and Jolie hiring a private detective to investigate  —   have been squashed on TMZ by “sources with intimate knowledge of the situation. ” But anyone who’s followed Jolie’s career should know better: Sad victimhood is not her style. As the divorce moves forward, Jolie will continue to navigate the landscape the way she’s done it best: with images, not words with actions, not   interviews. Jolie’s ultimate skill and unrivaled savvy has always stemmed from treating her image not as the defining core of her life, but an accessory of it. Her life isn’t the accumulation of her roles, her husbands, or even her children. Which is why, even as she slowly disappears from the movie screen, her image remains such a nexus of disdain and adoration  —   and, as in 2005, the most compelling and controversial vision of what it could mean to be a woman today.",

    "text": "UNITED NATIONS  —   Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday said his Russian counterpart’s explanation for how an aid convoy was bombed in Syria left him feeling “a little bit like they’re sort of in a parallel universe here. ” Kerry, speaking at a     meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss Syria, expressed incredulity at the Russian denial of its role in the airstrike and urged his fellow foreign ministers to continue to press for a political solution to the Syrian crisis. Ahead of the meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he was sure that Russia was not at fault and called for an independent investigation into the attack. The official Russian explanation has shifted multiple times since the strike was first reported  —   in its most recent comment, at the time of the meeting, Russia said the convoy was destroyed after its cargo caught fire. (Russia’s defense ministry has since claimed that a US Predator drone was in the area.) “The trucks and the food and the medicine just spontaneously combusted. Anybody here believe that?” Kerry asked the rest of the Council. “This is not a joke, we’re in serious business here. ” US officials on Tuesday said Russian planes were the only ones in the air just before an airstrike that destroyed 18 out of 31 trucks in a joint   Arab Red Crescent convoy delivering humanitarian aid to a remote area in the country. UN officials on Tuesday told BuzzFeed News that all parties knew exactly what was being transported by the convoy and what route it was taking. Kerry cited eyewitness reports, including one who said “the place turned into hell and fighter jets were in the sky,” according to the secretary. Syria’s UN ambassador to the UN, however, called into question the report, wondering how a person could see planes when “thousands of others” reported no planes. The attack on the aid convoy came just hours after Syria unilaterally declared the end of a ceasefire negotiated by the United States and Russia. Days before, jets with the   coalition mistakenly bombed a group of Syrian soldiers. Kerry noted that the US had admitted that it likely committed that error, and he urged Russia to do the same about Monday’s attack on the aid convoy. In order to make it safe for aid to move throughout Syria, Kerry said, Russia and Syria must “ground all aircraft in key areas to allow for humanitarian aid to flow unimpeded. ” “It’s a moment of truth” Kerry said, for Russia, for Syria, and for the international community alike. “If we allow spoilers to choose the path for us,” he said, “make no mistake my friends, the next time we convene here, we’re going to be facing a Middle East with more refugees, more dead, more extremist, and more suffering on an even greater scale. ” “The only choice is a ceasefire,” Kerry stressed, “to provide the people of Syria a chance to breathe to live. ” Addressing Russia directly again, Kerry said the US still believes “there is still a way forward. Our shared task here is to find a way to use the tools of diplomacy to make that happen. ”",

    "text": "For more than a half century, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  —   better known as the FARC  —   has been in a brutal civil war with the government. But now the two sides are on the verge of signing a peace treaty. This summer, I spent a total of five weeks with an elite FARC unit at different times and at different camps in the jungles of the southern state of Caquetá. The rebels came from fronts all over Colombia for a year’s education program to prepare them for leadership roles as the FARC prepares to transform itself from an armed rebel group into a leftist political party. Many of the rebels I met were unable to read or write when they joined the FARC but now were studying history, current affairs, and   political theory. More than a third were women, with many occupying command positions. The FARC has strict rules against sexual discrimination, although they have not always been observed. For many   in Colombia, the country’s   rebels are bogeymen  —   kidnappers, drug traffickers, and assassins. But p​eople who live in the vast areas of Colombian countryside controlled by the FARC tend to have a different view of the rebels. For them, the FARC replaced governments that always favored Colombia’s rich elite: The rebels have kept order, administered justice, built roads, and raised taxes. As part of the peace process the FARC has renounced kidnapping and has made commitments to abandon its involvement in the cocaine trade, historically two of its main sources of revenue.​ During the long and violent civil war FARC units have carried out massacres of civilians and selective assassinations, such as the 2009 killing of 27 members of the indigenous Awá people, including women and young children. ​Still, the bogeymen view of the FARC owes much to the country’s mainstream media, following the government’s lead. Colombia’s biggest newspaper, El Tiempo, is owned and run by the family of President Juan Manuel Santos, who was also defense minister in the previous administration. Foreign governments and media have frequently taken the same line. The United States declared the FARC a terrorist organization in 1997 and has still not lifted that classification. Many FARC members fear that after they disarm they will be vulnerable to assassination by   paramilitary groups in a repeat of the movement’s last attempt to enter civilian politics in the  . Then, around 3, 000 members of the FARC’s Patriotic Union party were murdered by   death squads. After four years of slow peace negotiations in Havana, Cuba, the FARC and the Colombian government are in an unprecedented honeymoon period. They have signed a bilateral ceasefire and provisional accords, and they are due to sign a final agreement on September 26. Combat commanders from both sides have met up, without guns, to talk about how they may work together in the future. The Colombian people will vote for or against the agreement in a plebiscite on October 2. FARC delegates are holding a conference September 17 —  23 in the southern state of Caquetá to discuss the treaty, and they will almost certainly approve it. I first reported on the FARC when I lived in Colombia in 1985 —  86, traveling several days on horseback to their mountain headquarters. Peace negotiations with the FARC began in 2012 in Havana. I flew there early this year and asked permission to visit their camps in Colombia. The FARC allowed me to photograph and interview whomever I wanted. The rebels I met were friendly, disciplined, ​thoughtful, and, apparently, idealistic.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON  —   New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said he gathered that “more people” seemed more outraged by Colin Kaepernick’s protest of the killing of unarmed black people at the hands of police than with the killing of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Okla. Booker reacted to news out of Oklahoma in which an unarmed black man, Terence Crutcher, exited his broken down vehicle before being pursued and then shot to death by police. “Right now on the Internet you have another unarmed African American who was murdered this week  —   or killed this week,” said Booker. “From the video that I saw, even with the way he was being referred to, I mean there is this dehumanization going on on the audio, and people seem to be more outraged by an NFL player taking a knee than the murder or killing of an unarmed black man. ” Booker, who reiterated his stance that he “disagreed” with the method of protest of the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, said he didn’t want the conversation the Kaepernick’s protest has sparked “to stop there”  —   all while acknowledging it was his constitutional right to do so. The issue of needing to change the criminal justice system was the central theme of a discussion of BuzzFeed Brews, an interview series with newsmakers which on Tuesday featured Sens. Cory Booker and Mike Lee. Lee, a Republican senator from Utah, and also one of the Senate’s biggest criminal justice advocates, also said he didn’t agree with Kaepernick’s methods. “I think it’s disrespectful but that is his right to choose to send that message in whatever way he deems appropriate. ” Booker credited the Black Lives Matter movement for bringing like to the issue of police brutality. He said there were “real issues” with police accountability. Booker said it’s one of “the biggest cancers in the country right now that in the land of free that pledges allegiance  —   we pledge ourselves, we swear an oath to the ideals of liberty and justice for all  —   [that] should have a criminal justice system that’s so broken. ” “To see so many young people taking to the streets,” Booker said, “to see so many activists much more conscious now  —   to see movements like Black Lives Matter  —   this is all stuff that’s encouraging to me. Because the truth of the matter is we didn’t get the civil rights movement because a bunch of senators sat around and said ‘Hey, this is a swell idea. ’”",

    "text": "There’s an episode of Black Mirror, a British television show that imagines life in the near future, that tells the story of a woman who reunites with her deceased lover, reincarnated thanks to the wonders of artificial intelligence. While alive, Ash, the boyfriend, spends his time religiously jotting down observations and recording images of things he sees in an app. And when he dies, a tech company uses this information to create a chatbot that mimics the way he talks and what he’s interested in (it gets darker from there). It’s a future that seems a bit far off in the show, but then again, the episode came out a few years before Google’s new messaging platform, Allo. Allo is a new   messaging app that debuts today on iOS and Android. It’s a fun, conversational interface, to be sure. But not only does it host your conversations, it also learns how you talk, and composes messages for you, in your style. Using Allo, which I first got my hands on last week, you can feel the   aspects of AI in a way you simply can’t in other   consumer products. And while Allo will likely struggle to break through in a saturated messaging app market, it would be foolish to write off its capacity to bring AI deeper into our lives. Remember, it’s powered by the heft of Google’s   history of learning what we want via our searches, and its seven distinct    products. Allo doesn’t quite take you into Black Mirror territory, but, for likely the first time in your life, it travels close enough for you to see it. Consider the following conversation between Nick Fox, Google’s VP of communications products, and myself: Me: “Hey! How are you?” Nick: “Pretty good. How are you?” Me: “I’m doing well. ” Nick: “That’s good to hear!” It may appear banal, but there’s something amazing about this conversation: None of it was written by either of us. For each of those messages, Nick and I picked text suggested by Allo via a feature called Smart Replies. Smart Reply suggestions are shown underneath the compose field in Allo and updated based on the context of the conversation. Tapping a Smart Reply sends it along as a message. When Fox sent me a picture of his kid, Allo looked at the picture and suggested I write back “beautiful smile” along with a smile emoji. What’s even more remarkable is how Allo adjusts after some use. If you usually say “Yo! Sup?” as a greeting, Allo will learn that and suggest the phrase instead of something more generic like “Hey! How are you?” It will also learn how you converse with different people, so it will suggest different messages to send to your boss and your wife and your pal. (Unless they’re the same person.) Smart Replies are available in Google’s Inbox product already (where people opt to use the   replies about 10% of the time, according to Google) but the live, fluid world of messaging is very different than the stilted world of email. In Allo’s case, the machines can talk to us  —   or each other, or some hybrid  —   in near real time. When Fox and I spoke without the assistance of AI, he told me that Allo’s Smart Replies work better for pleasantries and basic responses, and it probably won’t suggest things with deep detail, such as intentions to fly to another city later that day. “We’re not trying to replace human expression with Smart Replies,” he said. “We think of Smart Reply like a   it’s assisting you with your expression, it’s helping you with your expression rather than a replacement. ” Smart Replies, of course, are not simple  . They are far more advanced. But Fox’s implication was clear: Temper your expectations, and don’t fear this thing taking over human expression. Fair enough, but I still found myself tapping Smart Replies at almost every opportunity. The Google Assistant, While I was messaging with a Google team member on Allo, I wanted to share a bit more information about “Be Right Back,” the Black Mirror episode starring the chatbot boyfriend. My usual process for doing this would be to go to Google, search for “black mirror be right back,” click a link, copy it, and paste it into the messaging app. But inside Allo I simply wrote “@google black mirror be right back” and Google replied with a card filled more information about the episode. This was the work of the Google Assistant, the other big   feature in Allo. Assistant is akin to a   chatbot included in Allo, and you can bring it into any conversation you’re having within the app. In my discussion with Fox, he suggested I ask it to find nearby sushi places, and after I asked, it instantly replied with 10 options. Fox responded with the name of one place, and Assistant sent a card showing its rating, cost, hours, and a short description. Within the card, I could hit shortcuts to call the restaurant, get directions, or look at the menu. You can also talk directly to Google Assistant in a private chat. It can tell you the weather, find places to eat, search the internet, call up messages from your Gmail, play games, and more. It’s the most useful chatbot I’ve used other than Facebook’s M. (Of course, that’s a weak field most chatbots make me want to throw my phone out the window.) But it is perhaps most useful when it just pops into chats to help out. When I sent a colleague a photo of the Golden Gate Bridge, it suggested he respond with a Google query for Golden Gate Bridge, which fired a “quick intro” culled from Wikipedia. Tapping a   prompt gave us toll information, and then another tap sent us to Google Maps for directions. This all happened within a few seconds, and none of it felt like “searching. ” With Assistant, Google is creating a version of search adjusted for the fact that we spend most of our time in apps when we use our phones, and not in web browsers, which Google Search is built for. To remain competitive in this new world, Google knows search must live in various other forms, and releasing Assistant in Allo is just the start. Google will also embed Assistant in its Amazon     product Google Home, and elsewhere. Fox described the product as “a cohesive glue across a number of Google services. ” So yes, Allo is another messaging app entering a market where there are already more than enough. But to think of it as simply a messaging service misses the point. Allo’s introduction gives humans a place to interact with AI more intimately than ever before. A few days into using Allo, I’m on board with that. And frankly, if a company wants to take my conversations and turn me into chatbot after I die, I’m down with that too. Google, you have my permission.",

    "text": "’Tuesday afternoon, Belmont University released a statement addressing the issue, saying that the institution rejects “comments rooted in racism or bigotry,” and would investigate.’ ’About two hours later, the university released another statement announcing that the freshman “is no longer a student at Belmont. ”’] A freshman at Belmont University, a popular ”Christian” college, posted this last night. #WelcomeToAmerica in 2016. A student at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, posted a racist comment on Snapchat about NFL players who protested during the national anthem  —   and administrators later said he is “no longer a student” there. “Piece of shit niggers. Every one of them needs a damn bullet in their head,” wrote the freshman. “If you don’t like this country get the hell out. ” The university’s student paper, the Belmont Vision, named the student as Justin Woodard and said he was expelled. BuzzFeed News was unable to immediately confirm that was the student’s name. The student appeared to have taken the snap Monday night, when the Philadelphia Eagles faced the Chicago Bears. Eagles players Malcolm Jenkins, Ron Brooks, and Steven Means stood with their fists raised as the national anthem played, NBC reported. Scores of professional and amateur athletes across the country have taken part in protesting the national anthem. They have aligned themselves with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who made headlines for taking a knee when the song played on Aug. 26 in order to draw attention to police brutality and racial discrimination in the US. The Tennessean reported that the student’s Snapchat post went viral after Belmont students took screenshots and shared the image on Twitter and Facebook. Belmont rejects comments rooted in racism or bigotry. See statement below. UPDATE: After investigating the racist social media post, the person involved is no longer a student at Belmont. Belmont’s statement went on to say that as a Christian institution, “it is our goal to build a diverse and inclusive community where all students feel accepted, safe and valued. ” The incident comes the same month that black freshmen at American University said they had been harassed by a group of white men in recent weeks  —   including having bananas thrown at them  —   and that students at Eastern Michigan University found “KKK” and “Leave Niggers” spray painted on the side of a campus building.",

In the journal, the      man praised   founder Osama Bin Laden, the radical   cleric Anwar   and the 2009 mass shooting at Fort Hood, Texas. “He talked about pressure cooker bombs and pipe bombs in the streets as they planned to run a mile,” McCaul said, referencing the explosion that took place Saturday at a Marine Corps charity race in Seaside Park, New Jersey. According to McCaul, Rahami stated in the journal “his guidance” came from Abu Muhammad   the chief spokesperson and propagandist for the terror group ISIS, who was killed in a US drone strike in Syria in August. “Death to the oppression,” Rahami wrote. “God willing the sound of bombs will be heard in the streets. ”  —  Jon Passantino, Bharara went on to list that evidence, which included12 fingerprints on the “undetonated bomb” on 27th Street in Chelsea, surveillance video of Rahami near the detonated 23rd Street bomb   before the explosion and video of Rahami walking with a suitcase at 27th Street, and license plate readers that showed his vehicle, which was linked to his home address, entering Manhattan through the Lincoln Tunnel two hours before the explosion and leaving Manhattan two hours after.  Bharara also said during the press conference Wednesday that a “handwritten journal was found on Rahami at the time of his arrest” which mentioned, jihad, pipe bombs, a pressure cooker bomb and the sounds of bombs heard in the street. The journal, according to Bharara, also contained “laudatory” references to   founder Osama bin Laden and Anwar   an American citizen whose speeches have been credited with inspiring domestic terrorists even years after his death by a US drone strike in Yemen.  “This weekend, as you all appreciate, the American way of life was attacked and everyday routines were shaken by explosions in Chelsea and Seaside Park,” Bharara opened the press conference by saying.  “The response to these misguided acts of terror has been classically American, and what we have come to expect in our city from New Yorkers: care for the victims, calm in the midst of chaos, and swift law enforcement action. Now, thanks to that response, Rahami will face federal terrorism charges in a court of law. ”   —  Talal Ansari, Surveillance footage obtained by the FBI shows the two men “located a piece of luggage on the sidewalk, removed an improvised explosive device from the luggage, and then left the vicinity leaving the device behind but taking the luggage,” the FBI said in a statement. The video was taken on 27th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues in Manhattan, and was taken within the same hour a bomb exploded four blocks south, on 23rd Street, injuring 29 people. “The FBI is interested in speaking to these individuals and recovering the luggage,” the agency said.  A widely circulated photo of the improvised explosive device revealed it was a pressure cooker bomb with exposed wires.   —   Talal Ansari, FBI seeks public’s help in locating two men related to   investigation https:  .  The complaint against Rahami, filed in the Southern District of New York, includes four charges: Use of weapons of mass destruction, bombing a place of public use, destruction of property by means of fire or explosive, and use of a destructive device during and in furtherance of a crime of violence. Prosecutors also charged Rahami in New Jersey Tuesday with six counts related to using weapons of mass destruction and bombs. Several of Rahami’s charges in both states carry potential life sentences.  The complaints also provide details about how Rahami allegedly bought, built, and tried to detonate the bombs. At the site of an explosion at Seaside Park in New Jersey, for example, investigators found an explosive device made of three pipe bombs. They also found a cell phone in the area that they believe was used as a timer for the bomb.  At the scene of the explosion in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood, investigators found ball bearings and steel nuts they believe were packed into a pressure cooker bomb to make it more deadly scattered over the blast site that spanned 650 square feet. The complaint mentions two victims who were inside cars but nevertheless injured when the bomb went off. As was the case with the New Jersey explosion, investigators believe Rahami used a cellphone as a timer for the Chelsea bomb. Prosecutors believe Rahami bought bomb components, including chemicals and devices he could use as detonators, on Ebay. The complaint describes purchases going back to June 20 and continuing through August. The complaint also states that investigators searched social media accounts believed to belong to Rahami and found that he had liked videos related to jihad.  In addition, authorities recovered what they describe as Rahami’s handwritten journal. In it, Rahami allegedly praises   leader Anwar   and Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan. According to the complaint, his journal concludes: “Inshallah [God willing] the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death To Your OPPRESSION. ”  —   Jim Dalrymple II, It remains unclear what law enforcement agency has taken the lead on interrogating Rahami. The FBI did not respond to questions asking whether federal interrogators had yet gained access to the suspect.  —   Ali Watkins, “In August 2014, the FBI initiated an assessment of Ahmad Rahami based upon comments made by his father after a domestic dispute that were subsequently reported to authorities,” the FBI said in a statement sent to BuzzFeed News.  “The FBI conducted internal database reviews, interagency checks, and multiple interviews, none of which revealed ties to terrorism. ” His father, Mohammad Rahami, told the New York Times earlier on Tuesday he called authorities because his son was “doing really bad. ” “Two years ago I go to the FBI because my son was doing really bad, OK?” Mohammad Rahami said. “But they check almost two months, they say, ‘He’s OK, he’s clean, he’s not a terrorist.’ I say OK. ”  —  David Mack, On Tuesday, while speaking with reporters outside the family’s restaurant in Elizabeth, N. J. Mohammad Rahami said, “I called the FBI two years ago,” the New York Times reported. “Two years ago I go to the FBI because my son was doing really bad, OK?” Mohammad Rahami said. “But they check almost two months, they say, ‘He’s OK, he’s clean, he’s not a terrorist.’ I say OK. ” “Now they say he is a terrorist,” Rahami said. “I say OK. ” The Associated Press reported that Mohammad Rahami contacted the FBI in 2014 and told them that he believed his son was a terrorist, but later retracted the statement, according to an official. ABC News reported that in the summer of 2014 a “concerned citizen” also called police in New Jersey to report that Mohammad Rahami had said that his son may be in contact with individuals overseas who were collecting explosives. Based on this report, a “Suspicious Activity Report” was compiled on Rahami and sent to the FBI. Federal agents then interviewed Mohammad Rahami, who told the FBI that his son had traveled to Pakistan and was interacting with “bad people,” ABC News reported. The handwritten notes also referenced the 2009 Fort Hood shooting that left 13 people dead and 30 others injured, and was described to NBC News as “a hodge podge, a rambling, disconnected, choppy series of references to past events. ”    who was killed in a US drone strike in 2011 in Yemen, was a spokesman for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and editor of the terrorist group’s online magazine Inspire. In one section of Rahami’s notes, which were covered in blood and pierced by a bullet hole, the    wrote of “killing the kuffar,” or unbeliever, the New York Times reported. NBC originally said the note was found on an unexploded pressure cooker bomb left Saturday night on 27th Street in Manhattan, four blocks from where another exploded, but CNN and the Washington Post said the note was found on Rahami after his arrest Monday in Linden, New Jersey.  —  Jon Passantino, The official said authorities were working with officials in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates to find her and question her about what she knew of her husband’s actions.  On Monday, a New Jersey lawmaker said Rahami had contacted his office when he was in Pakistan in 2014 to ask for help in securing a visa for his pregnant wife. Rep. Albio Sires said Rahami emailed his office in 2014 after his wife’s Pakistani passport expired, the Associated Press reported. Sires said he contacted the FBI about Rahami’s request, and the follow up letter his office sent to the US embassy in Pakistan, after he was named as a suspect. Bar owner who spotted Bombings suspect speaks out: It ”shocked me” https:  .  https:  .  Bains said it was raining when he saw that he thought was just a drunk man sleeping outside his bar with a hoodie pulled around his face. Around 9 a. m. Rahami was leaning against the door of the bar, which had a cracked piece of glass, so Bains suggested that he move. “I said, ‘Hey buddy, you’re going to get hurt, this door is cracked,’” Bains recalled. Rahami moved, but as he did Bains got a glimpse of his face and “was shocked” when he recognized the same person he had seen earlier on CNN’s website. Later, Bains told a friend about the man who resembled the bombing suspect.  The friend suggested contacting law enforcement, so Bains called the Linden Police Department.  A shootout ensued later Monday morning when Lindon police arrived at the scene. Bains said he saw two officers arrive, then watched as Rahami fired two shots at them. Rahami then ran, “firing in the air,” Bains said.  “The whole thing took maybe 30 seconds or less than 30 seconds,” Bains said.  Rahami and two officers were wounded in the shootout, but no one was killed. Rahami remains in custody after being hospitalized for his injuries.  Bains was praised in the aftermath for recognizing the man and alerting authorities, but told CNN instead that he simply believes “when you see something you should say something. ” “I’m not a hero,” Bains added. “I’m just a citizen doing what every citizen should do. ” Rep. Albio Sires said Rahami, a US citizen who was born in Afghanistan, emailed his office in 2014 after his wife’s Pakistani passport expired, the Associated Press reported. Rahami, who remains in custody after alleging planting bombs in New York and New Jersey and getting in a shootout with police, was charged with attempted murder and other weapons related crimes on Monday. Sires said he contacted the FBI about Rahami’s request, and the follow up letter his office sent to the US embassy in Pakistan, after he was named as a suspect. It was unclear if Rahami wife ever came to the US.  —  Jason Wells, Union County Prosecutor Grace H. Park announced the charges over the shootout that occurred on Monday morning prior to Rahami’s capture by police. Rahami is also facing two   charges over his alleged possession of a handgun. “At approximately 10:30 a. m. on Monday morning, a uniformed Linden police officer approached a man later identified as Rahami outside a bar on East Elizabeth Avenue, according to the investigation,” the prosecutor’s office said in a statement. “At that time, Rahami immediately produced a handgun and shot the officer in the torso, striking him in his protective vest. ” “Additional patrol officers responding to the scene engaged Rahami in an exchange of gunfire that ended when Rahami was shot multiple times outside of an auto repair shop on East Elizabeth Avenue, several blocks west of where he was initially approached,” the prosecutor’s office said. Bail for Rahami was set at $5. 2 million by state Superior Court Judge Regina Caulfield. Each attempted murder charge carries potential prison term of 10 to 20 years, while Rahami could also face jail terms of   years for each weapons charges.  —  David Mack, The    woman told Fox Rahami did not pay child support and was angry at Western culture. “He would speak often of Western culture and how it was different back home,” she said. “How there weren’t homosexuals in Afghanistan. “He seemed standoffish to American culture, but I never thought he would cross the line. “One time, he was watching TV with my daughter and a woman in a [military] uniform came on and he told [their daughter] ‘That’s the bad person,’” she said. Here’s everything we know so far about Rahami.  —  David Mack, “Remember that we’re less than 48 hours into a multitude of five attacks,” Burr told BuzzFeed News. “And in less than 48 hours we have somebody in custody. But 48 hours is not enough to take the media or the weapons and do the forensics on them we need to do to make that determination. ” He added that authorities also do not yet know if there was more than one person involved in the attacks, in the US or abroad.  “We won’t know until we’ve worked with the media we’ve got,” he said.  —   Emma Loop,",

    "text": "ISTANBUL  —   The Syrian government and its Russian allies were fully aware of the location of the humanitarian aid convoy that was bombed in Aleppo on Monday  —   and had approved even small details of its mission. As part of an exhaustive approval process for the aid convoy, the Syrian government  —   as well as Russia, the US, and its rebel allies  —   was provided a list of the contents in the convoy’s 31 trucks along with GPS coordinates for the route it planned to take. The Syrian government then inspected the trucks before they departed its territory and received regular updates on the movements of the convoy as it drove through   area, as did the other parties in the conflict, said David Swanson, the spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. “With all this knowledge of [the delivery] in advance, and the fact that it was   and the fact that all parties of the conflict were notified,” he said, “how could this attack take place?” The convoy was organized by the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and assisted by workers from the Syrian Red Crescent  —   it was part of a humanitarian effort that had brought aid to more than 1. 2 million people in the   country in 2016 alone. Its mission  —   before a series of airstrikes on Monday night hit 18 of its 31 trucks and killed at least 20 people, including a senior aid worker  —   was to deliver food and medical supplies to help an estimated 78, 000 residents of Aleppo’s   western countryside. The   planning process was standard for such deliveries, Swanson said. Since the convoy traveled first through government territory before crossing rebel lines, it also requires explicit permission of the Syrian government. “The route is approved,” Swanson said. “This is negotiated with all parties to the conflict in advance. ” In addition to the fact that updates on the convoy’s movements were provided to the parties of the conflict, it was clearly marked as a humanitarian convoy. It was also attacked as it approached an established warehouse  —   its location was well known  —   used by the Syrian Red Crescent to store humanitarian supplies, raising further questions over whether the attack could have been unintentional. “If this convoy was deliberately targeted, then you have what can easily be classified as a war crime,” Swanson said. The UN has stopped short of assigning blame for the airstrikes. But US officials have said that either Syrian or Russian jets, or a combination of both, launched the attacks, echoing the initial reports of monitoring groups tracking the conflict. “They knew exactly where this convoy would be,” an official with the Obama administration said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the issue’s sensitivity. “It’s an outrage. ” Officials with the UN and associated humanitarian groups who spoke to BuzzFeed News on condition of anonymity said the process of approving the convoy with the Syrian regime and Russian military would have left little room for deadly targeting errors. “There had been an extensive   process with Russian and Syrian officials [to plan the convoy],” said one UN official based along the Turkish border with Syria. The official described a series of meetings that included descriptions of inventory for the convoy, the route and timing of the trucks as well as approval for the members of the convoy itself, coordinated through the ICRC, UN and other groups with the Syrian government. “There were multiple discussions between the UN officials and Damascus,” the official said. “Approval for the convoy came directly from coordination in    meetings in Damascus with the regime. ” According to one eyewitness, the airstrikes took place over a period of time and appeared intentional. Hussein Badawi, a rescue worker who was on the scene, told BuzzFeed News that planes had circled the area before a series of airstrikes was launched. The attacks included barrel bombs, he said, crude explosive devices that are deployed by the Syrian military. “We pulled four wounded people from the rubble, and [I saw] more than 12 people dead,” said Badawi, who is the head of the Syrian Civil Defense, the rescue workers known as the White Helmets, in the area. “And they destroyed the humanitarian supplies that everyone knows were meant to help civilians. ” According to a network of civilian monitors that tracks Syrian and Russian airstrikes in northern Syria in order to provide advance warning to residents, there was at least one Russian aircraft in the vicinity at the time of the strikes, as well as multiple   helicopters and jets. The network requested that its name be withheld for fear of being targeted for retaliation. On Tuesday, both the Syrian and Russian governments denied involvement in the attacks. News of the attacks sent a shockwave through the humanitarian community. The UN announced on Tuesday that it had suspended all aid convoys in the country. Officials with NGOs working in Syria were quick to take note. “The question [is] whether it was deliberate? The answer is undoubtedly,” read a security assessment circulated by one prominent NGO based on the Turkey —  Syria border on Tuesday, which was provided to BuzzFeed News on condition that the organization not be named. “This was   aid, in other words   by [the Syrian government] which would have had a copy of the convoy paperwork. On that paperwork, all predicted arrival and departure times are listed, and GPS coordinates provided for every location mentioned. ” The fragile ceasefire in Syria had broken down just hours earlier as the   convoy rolled through the Aleppo countryside with assurance from all parties in the conflict that it would be safe. After the missiles rained down, Omar Barakat, the head of the Syrian Red Crescent in the area, was among the dead. Speaking by phone on Tuesday, Barakat’s    Yahya Mayo, said he believed the Syrian government was to blame. “This has been happening since 2011,” he said, referring to the start of the conflict. “They attacked hospitals, civilians, schools. These are war crimes. ”",

    "text": "NEW YORK  —   The European Union does not need its own army, Latvian President Raimonds Vējonis told BuzzFeed News, jumping into a debate that has split Europe’s leaders. “I have been a minister of defense, and I can say my personal opinion is that we don’t need a European army,” Vējonis said during an interview on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. “We need to strengthen our national armies, yes. Because the largest part of EU countries are NATO members, we are investing a lot in [the] strengthening and development of our national armies. ” Discussion of an EU army has revived since the United Kingdom, which stood against a more integrated defense policy, voted to leave the European Union. On Sept. 8, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini revealed a new set of plans to move the idea forward, including establishing a headquarters in Brussels to coordinate future and present military and civilian actions and utilizing   units more. Mogherini, who has insisted that her proposals don’t constitute an EU army, said that   there is a “general consensus on the need to move forward in this field. ” Latvian officials, including the foreign minister and prime minister, and those of other former Soviet states have been skeptical, fearing the European initiative would compete with NATO  —   the military alliance they rely on, particularly at a time when Russia is resurgent. “The situation in Ukraine opened the eyes of many leaders of countries, not only in the EU but the whole world,” Vējonis said, referring to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014. Vējonis, who has been president since July 2015, said the US had been a “driving force” in responding to the Ukraine crisis and provided the first soldiers to help shore up Latvia’s defenses, deploying 150 soldiers to each of the three Baltic states. The US has been criticized for not doing enough to aid Ukraine in responding to the   rebels in its east and assuage the worries of other countries that fell within Russia’s sphere of influence during the Cold War. In March, NATO leaders agreed to station up to 4, 000 troops in the Baltics and eastern Poland. Russia has particularly tried to stoke   populations around the former Soviet Union, including through propaganda directed at them. Vējonis dismissed that concern, however, saying of Latvia’s   minority, which numbers 200, 000 in a country of 1. 9 million: “They are very loyal. ” Vējonis also said the refugee crisis posed a challenge to the country: “I think it’s not necessary to establish a special European army, but at the same time we have to work together to strengthen the borders of our EU,” particularly on the union’s southern border, which saw the brunt of refugee arrivals. Vējonis declined to comment directly on the US election but did allude to one of the most controversial statements made by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who threatened to not come to the aid of NATO countries who didn’t pay their dues. While not explicitly linking to Trump’s statement, Vējonis was quick to highlight his country’s commitment to achieving the 2% of GDP spending on defense target that NATO countries have previously agreed upon. “All NATO member states, and all EU members states who are part of NATO, must follow this goal,” he said. Republican candidate Donald Trump, who has implied that the United States would not help a NATO ally in need should it not reach its GDP spending goals, would need to adhere to the terms of NATO if he was elected, Vējonis said. “We believe that any leader who will be elected   …     any leader who will lead the US must follow already agreed things,” he said. “We signed this agreement, we ratified this agreement, it means we must follow responsibly all points, to all articles in this agreement, because we are serious countries. ” But when asked if there was any fear at all that Trump would attempt to remove the US from the North Atlantic Treaty, which set up NATO, Vējonis hedged. “It’s difficult to say,” he responded.",

    "text": "A computer told Ana Brant that the   care deeply about their breakfast options. This came as a surprise. Brant is the director of guest experience and innovation for the Dorchester Collection, a hotel group that counts among its properties the Beverly Hills Hotel, the Hotel Eden in Rome, and Le Meurice in Paris, where rooms start at $780 a night and wind their way up to over $16, 000 for the Belle Etoile (“beautiful star”) suite. Her job, which she describes on LinkedIn as “the science of luxury service,” is to listen to the very wealthy people who stay in her company’s hotels, so they keep staying there instead of, say, the Peninsula, the St. Regis, or the Mandarin Oriental. Hotels of this kind throw mountains of money at celebrity chefs to build fine dining destinations. Dinner is the main event. Breakfast is often an afterthought. And yet here was   proof  —   delivered by machine learning software called Metis, which analyzes online customer reviews  —   that Dorchester Collection guests write way more about breakfast in their reviews than dinner. The algorithm found that the   actually do like the idea of a buffet  —   but only if it comes in the form of a waiter who says he can make anything. Metis also found that guests loved to customize their breakfasts they were, as Brant put it, “looking at breakfast menus as an inspirational list of ingredients. ” So she went to her chefs. It turned out Metis was right: Dorchester kitchens reported that somewhere between 80 and 90% of breakfast orders are modified. So today, when you sit down to breakfast at the Beverly Hills Hotel (which has 1, 019 reviews on TripAdvisor, 298 on Booking. com, 235 on Yelp, and 294 on Expedia) a waiter comes up to you and asks what you want  —   they’ve got everything. No menu. “Guests love it,” Brant said. “It’s a Hollywood crowd. Everyone has their own diet. ” And it’s all because of an algorithm, one that could signal a new way for customer service businesses to study their clientele: through the collection and analysis of their own words. In the past, luxury businesses have had to rely on “secret shoppers” and customer feedback forms to improve their service. Now, Metis is taking the massive trove of consumer data on customer review sites like TripAdvisor and Booking. com and turning it into market research that will tell businesses what their elite clients want, before they know they want it. It began with a little bit of customer feedback. Around five years ago, as review sites started to flourish, David and Kyle Richey, who for nearly four decades have run the luxury consulting firm Richey International, noticed that their clients were aghast. “Hotels that we were dealing with were starting to feel overwhelmed by the amount of data that was coming at them,” said Kyle Richey. Hotels didn’t know how to handle the sheer volume of feedback on the sites and saw it as a headache. But the Richeys  —   whose clients include the Ritz Paris, Viking River Cruises, and the NFL  —   saw it as a potential source of value. “We realized that there is rich content within the reviews, but everyone was using them for PR value,” Kyle Richey said. “No one was using them for operational value or strategy, because it’s hard to read thousands of reviews and find the trends. ” In other words, businesses were slapping positive Yelp reviews on their windows, not using the feedback to improve. In 2013, the Richeys started meeting with text analytics firms in the Bay Area, where they’re based, to develop a way to turn reviews into advice. But all of the firms’ proposals were overly complex. So they hired their own engineers to write machine learning software that could look for words and phrases that correlate with important customer service metrics like emotional bond and loyalty. Then they turned that software over to Werner Koepf, the senior vice president of engineering at Conversica, which makes AI for marketing and sales, to build a web app that their clients could use. Finally, after two years and several million dollars of their own money, the Richeys were ready to demo Metis. Brant, their first client, was bowled over. “I thought, Oh my goodness,” Brant said. “This is going to be the most amazing thing ever.“ In June 2015, Brant took a Metis demo comparing six   hotels in New York to a meeting of Dorchester Collection general managers in LA. The managers were impressed, particularly by a finding that a “super iconic and amazing hotel had a serious issue with leadership  —   people were running away when a customer complained. ” They approved a Metis study on the spot. So the Richeys ran Metis on over 8, 000 TripAdvisor reviews, some on Dorchester hotels and some on competitors. That’s what led Brant to the realization that the   actually do like the idea of a buffet  —   choosing exactly what they want  —   but only if it comes in the form of a waiter who says he can make anything. “If you want to continue to be a true luxury, you have to figure out a way to draw insights that no one has ever had. ” Metis’s findings went further than breakfast. The analysis found that words related to relaxation and unwinding were closely correlated with words related to emotional bond and loyalty (words like “recommend” and “return”). In reviews of the   Hotel   the software found that guests frequently mentioned words like “relaxation,” “unwinding,” and “pampered” alongside descriptions of patios, terraces, and fireplaces. Brant realized that photos on the hotel website didn’t emphasize the rooms’ outdoor features  —   a situation she quickly changed. Now the Dorchester Collection places Google keyword bids on words such as “fireplace” and “terrace. ” (Companies pay Google for ads to show up next to search results for certain words.) If the changes prompted by Metis seem granular  —   some music in the hotel bar here, an easily selfied vantage point there (“If the customer can’t insinuate himself into the view, it doesn’t exist,” said David Richey)  —   that’s sort of the point. The hidden desires of    hotel customers, who are used to an extraordinarily high standard of service, come down to the details. Differentiation happens at the margins. “If you want to continue to be a true luxury,” Brant said, “you have to figure out a way to draw insights that no one has ever had. ” Yes, luxury hotels now have at their disposal a computer program that can divine the small details to lure the, as Brant put it, “  executives,   celebrities, fashion executives, politicians, and notable businessmen” away from their competition. And who, exactly, will be drawing these insights and adjusting these details? So far, the Richeys have used Metis for about 15 clients, including Viking River Cruises and a “major sports league. ” That’s not for lack of demand: Kyle Richey said Metis has received “strong interest from major brands, including a very   Swiss jeweler. ” The Richeys stressed, though, that the tool is in its early days and that they want to proceed slowly. That said, their goals are huge. “My hope is that it will change the nature of market research,” Kyle Richey said. That would mean, presumably, broadening Metis’s use past luxury industries and into the larger world of customer service. Could we one day soon see major changes to the Cheesecake Factory and Foot Locker based on an algorithm’s analysis of thousands of online reviews? Perhaps, but don’t ask Ana Brant. “I’ve always been in luxury,” Brant said. “I’m not sure what triggers the masses. ”",

His comments come after two days of violent protests in Charlotte following the   death of Keith Lamont Scott. When asked what protesters’ grievances were on a BBC TV news program, Pittenger said: “The grievance in their minds  —   the animus, the anger  —   they hate white people because white people are successful and they’re not. ” “It is a welfare state,” he said. “We have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, and we’ve put people in bondage, so they can’t be all they’re capable of being. ” Pittenger apologized later Thursday in a statement. Read more here.  —  Michelle Broder Van Dyke, He was identified as    Justin Carr of Charlotte, WCCB reported, and police said they have started a homicide investigation.  Officials had initially said Wednesday night that Carr had died, then corrected their statement to say he was on life support. Carr succumbed to his injuries on Thursday, and his family was notified of his death.  Police earlier said in a statement that Carr was not shot by an officer. But two witnesses told BuzzFeed News they saw Carr fall to the ground as police were firing rubber bullets.  Police on Thursday said Carr appeared to be suffering from a gunshot wound before he died, and the investigation is ongoing.  —  Claudia Koerner, The announcement from the family’s attorney came little more than an hour after he said they were too overcome with grief to address reporters. After seeing the videos, the family has asked police to release them to the public. In a statement, family attorney Justin Bamberg said though the videos were difficult to watch, their release would serve transparency and the greater public good.  In the body camera and dash cam video, Scott can be seen exiting his vehicle in a calm manner, and he did not aggressively approach police, the family said. But major questions remain.  “It is impossible to discern from the videos what, if anything, Mr. Scott is holding in his hands,” Bamberg said. “When he was shot and killed, Mr. Scott’s hands were by his side and he was slowly walking backwards. ” The family said they will continue their own investigation into Scott’s death.  “For those who wish to protest, we urge you to do so peacefully,” the family said in a statement.  —  Jason Wells, “Emotionally, they weren’t ready,” attorney Justin Bamberg said.  Scott had been married for 20 years and had seven children in what was described as   family. His wife, Rakeyia, was also there when he died, Bamberg said.  “His wife saw him get shot, and that’s something she will never, ever forget,” he said.  Family members were set to review video of the shooting on Thursday, and Bamberg said they were hoping it would provide answers. Witnesses to the shooting maintain that Scott did not have a gun, as police have said. As far as Scott’s family knew, he didn’t own or carry a handgun, Bamberg said.  “I haven’t seen any evidence,” he said. “None of you have seen any evidence that a gun was there. ” And while some in the community have called for the video to be released publicly, Bamberg said Scott’s family want to see what it shows first. He referenced other videos that have shown people being killed by police.  “That is traumatic,” he said. “We have become desensitized as a society of the killing of citizens in this country, and these videos contribute to that. ” Bamberg reiterated that the family does not support violence or looting, a statement they also made Wednesday afternoon.  “But they do support citizens and their right to voice their frustration, to voice their anger,” he said. The treatment of minority Americans by police is a problem, he added. “They’re guilty until proven innocent,” Bamberg said. “They’re a threat until they prove they’re not a threat, and quite frankly, many feel like they’re inhuman until they’re proven to be human. ”  —  Claudia Koerner, National Guard troops, had “mobilized” in the city “from all over the state,” he added, with their primary duty to protect buildings and businesses. Multiple storefronts were smashed in during protests in Uptown overnight Wednesday, dozens of people were arrested, and one man who was shot remained in critical condition. “We cannot tolerate any types of violence on citizens or destruction of property,” McCrory said. McCrory, who also declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, did not address demands from the community to release video of the fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which set off the demonstrations. “We’re not going to let a few hours give a negative impact on a great city,” McCrory said in responding to a reporter, adding that “I still live here, and I’m proud to live here. ” He added that he had a “very nice conversation” with President Obama earlier in the day, but did not elaborate on what they discussed. The news conference was also attended by Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts and Charlotte Police Chief Kerr Putney.   —  Talal Ansari, “First, I want to express my condolences to the Scott family for their loss. I also wish for a full recovery to those who have been injured. “In light of the tragic events of the past three days, it is more important than ever that we restore calm and come together, as a community, in peaceful demonstration and conversation, and in constructive and   ways. As part of the fabric of Charlotte, the Hornets organization is committed to working with civic leaders, our elected leaders and law enforcement to foster more trust, transparency and understanding so we can heal and grow together as a community. ”  —  Jon Passantino, Atty. General comments on recent police shootings: Let’s work to ensure ”all Americans have both a voice and value” https:  .  “We hear your voices and we feel your pain,” Lynch said. In addition, she asked those responsible for violence during the protests to stop, adding that their actions are “drowning out the voices of commitment and change and ushering in more tragedy and grief in our communities. ” The Justice Department and FBI are monitoring the situation and Lynch said that DOJ was sending four community relations officials to assist in Charlotte on Thursday. “The tragic events in Charlotte and in Tulsa, Oklahoma, earlier this week, once again have underscored the divisions that persists between law enforcement officers and the communities that we serve, particularly communities of color,” she said.  Lynch added that one of her top priorities is to help heal the divides between law enforcement and the communities they serve. “Under state law, the District Attorney must ask for an SBI investigation when he receives a request to do so from the family of a person who was killed as a result of the use of a firearm by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty,” a statement from district attorney Andrew Murray reads. “After speaking with an attorney representing Mr. Scott’s family today, the District Attorney’s Office asked the SBI to investigate the incident. ”  —  Mary Ann Georgantopoulos, “Ultimately, our practice has been not to release” video,   Police Chief Kerr Putney said, but added that a “request has come our way for the party to see it. ” He was referring to Scott’s family, who is expected to watch the video this afternoon. The press conference came after a second night of violent protests left countless buildings damaged in the North Carolina city, resulting in 44 arrests. Nine civilians and five officers also suffered injuries. Putney added that due to the possibility of an external investigation, releasing it now could threaten the integrity of the case. “We release it when we believe it is a compelling reason,” he said, “but I’m not going to jeopardize the investigation. ” The police chief reiterated his statement that the video itself did not provide concrete evidence that Scott pointed a gun at officers when he was confronted on Tuesday. “The video does not give me absolute, definitive, visual evidence that would confirm that a person is pointing a gun,” Putney said. “I did not see that in the videos that reviewed. ” He maintained, though, the totality of the evidence, “supports the version of the truth that we gave. ” When a reporter pointed out that Putney had previously promised full transparency in the investigation of Scott’s death, the police chief corrected him. “I never said full transparency. I said transparency,” he said. “If you think we should display a victim’s worst day for public consumption, that’s not the kind of transparency I’m speaking of. ” What began as a peaceful protest soon turned violent, Roberts said, as one civilian was shot in the head and is currently in critical condition.  Putney said that around 8:30 p. m. Wednesday, officers responded to a call of an assault with a deadly weapon. One person was located with a gunshot wound near Omni Hotel.  Medics had difficulty penetrating the crowd to reach the victim, so officers carried the individual out, he said. At 8:43 p. m. police deployed gas “because of the size of the crowd,” Putney said. “I’m not defending the position,” he added. As the investigation into that shooting continues, businesses throughout the city are back up and running, and Roberts again urged civilians to remain calm and to continue engaging in peaceful protest. “This is a difficult period for our city. This is not the Charlotte that we know and love,” she said.  —   Tamerra Griffin, Statement from Carolina #Panthers President Danny Morrison, The statement says the team is in contact with government and law enforcement officials.  The Panthers are scheduled to host the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday at 1 pm.   —  Mary Ann Georgantopoulos,   Police Chief Kerr Putney said Wednesday that the officer who fired the fatal shots was not wearing a body camera during the incident but three other officers at the scene were wearing them, according to NBC News. Video was also pulled from the police cruiser’s dashcam.   —  Jessica Simeone, JUST IN: @CLTgov: Will hold a news conference at 10:30am   @CLTMayor, CMPD Chief Putney,  other gov officials.

    "text": "The first time Priyanka Singh suffered the wrath of Twitter’s brutish underbelly, she cried herself to sleep. A    from Delhi working in education publishing, Singh is also an atheist and an outspoken critic of India’s casteism and rape culture  —   a choice she pays dearly for in her Twitter mentions. Her abuse on the platform began in February and in the ensuing months has become routine: rape threats,     strangers wishing her and her family harm. The harassment took a toll. “I became aggressive online and defensive at home,” Singh told BuzzFeed News. Her relationship with her   deteriorated as she obsessed over the vitriol and invective directed at her on Twitter. It consumed her time, her energy. At work, Singh was preoccupied and easily agitated. When a troll alerted her employer to some of her tweets, her colleagues and managers urged her to delete her account, suggesting that Twitter “wasn’t real life. ” Clearly, fighting back wasn’t helping. “It only adds to the humiliation when you pour your heart out and you get an automated message saying, ‘We don’t consider this offensive enough. ’” Meanwhile, on Twitter, Singh was a “cunt. ” Or a “feminazi” or a “whore and jihadi. ” When her Twitter tormentors discovered Singh had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, they attacked her for that, too, tweeting, “Your brain is fucked up. ” Eventually Singh began cataloging her abuse. She diligently took screenshots of the harassing tweets and reported them to Twitter. Each time (save for once in August when Twitter suspended a lone tormenter’s account) the company’s response was the same: “We’ve investigated the account and reported tweets for violent threats and abusive behavior, and have found that it’s currently not violating the Twitter rules. ” Singh was devastated. “It only adds to the humiliation when you pour your heart out and you get an automated message saying, ‘We don’t consider this offensive enough,’” she said. So, like countless victims of harassment, Singh stopped trying. She made the tedious task of   part of her daily routine, and tried to shrug off the abuse. And on Twitter, the trolls kept on trolling. Over a decade into Twitter’s existence, harassment of the sort Singh suffered is a   and common practice on the platform. But Twitter’s protocols for reporting abuse and addressing it remain largely opaque. Until 2014, simply reporting abuse was a cumbersome process, requiring users to fill out an arduous, but thorough   questionnaire. Today, the process is somewhat more streamlined. Users can now report abuse they see on behalf of others, and in April of this year the service finally allowed users to report multiple tweets at once. But despite these tweaks, countless targets of abuse have found that their reports  —   no matter how vile their content  —   don’t meet Twitter’s standards for harassment. Users receive no justification besides a “thank you” and a prompt to contact law enforcement if they feel they are in danger. Take Kelly Ellis. Ellis, a software engineer at Medium with a verified account and over 11, 000 followers, was mercilessly tormented by a single Twitter user for weeks this past summer. By the time her antagonist, @fredcarson9151, concluded his   barrage of abuse, Ellis had listened to her accuser publicly express a desire for her to be raped. She’d also been berated as a “psychotic man hating ‘feminist’” and told that “men don’t need her opinion” on matters of sexual assault. Ellis reported the abuse and Twitter investigated it. But the conclusion of the company’s investigation was perplexing. Ellis said Twitter told her that the behavior she reported did not violate its rules, which explicitly state that one may not “threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease. ” BuzzFeed News documented Ellis’s experience in a story widely shared across social media. Two hours after its publication, @fredcarson9151 was banned from Twitter. Singh and Ellis’s stories are common despite vigilantly reporting abuse to Twitter, countless victims of harassment allege they see little in the way of an effective response from the company. Attacks recur, mentions remain toxic. To better understand how Twitter handles reports of harassment, BuzzFeed News invited readers to complete an online survey about abuse. More than 2, 700 users responded. The results suggest that an overwhelming majority of reported abuse requests ended with Twitter taking no visible action toward the offending account. Before we dig into the results, a few important caveats: Our survey was distributed primarily through BuzzFeed’s social channels, largely on Twitter and via a link in a BuzzFeed News post. As such, the 2, 702 respondents are likely not reflective of Twitter’s users overall. Respondents who participated in this survey were largely   speakers. By virtue of the subject matter, participants were probably more likely to have experienced abuse on Twitter than the average user of the service. (That said, respondents were given an option to state that they had not experienced abuse on Twitter.) BuzzFeed News also conducted   interviews with a number of respondents. Also worth noting: We’ve seen evidence that Twitter occasionally takes action against tweets reported as abusive without revealing that it has done so. But this leaves targets of abuse who reached out to the company in the dark about whether their appeals for help were heard. In some instances, Twitter has publicly revealed that it deleted tweets after a   outcry. Just yesterday, Binyamin Appelbaum, a New York Times correspondent with more than 40, 000 followers, retweeted some particularly horrific   remarks that had been directed at him and copied Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey. Afterward, the company deleted the tweets and Dorsey notified Applebaum of the deletions publicly on Twitter. All this said, the responses to our survey do offer a human window into Twitter’s underbelly of abuse, providing not only harrowing examples of harassment, but data on how it is handled  —   or not  —   by the social network. According to survey respondents, Twitter’s most common response to an abuse report is inaction. Roughly   of people BuzzFeed News surveyed who’d received an abusive tweet said they logged it via Twitter’s violation reporting page nearly 80% of our respondents said they reported an abusive tweet on behalf of somebody else. But very few reported ever receiving a response from the company. 46% of respondents told BuzzFeed News that the last time they reported an abusive tweet to Twitter, the company took no action on their request their only recourse was to personally block the offending account. Another 29% who reported abusive tweets said they never heard anything back at all. And 18% of those who reported an abusive tweet said they were told that the tweet did not violate Twitter’s rules, which explicitly forbid violent threats, harassment, and hateful conduct. In just 56 instances (2. 6% of the time) respondents said Twitter deleted the offending account, and in 22 instances (1% of the time) respondents said Twitter issued a warning to the user who’d sent the tweet. Of the 2, 115 people who responded to this particular survey question, just five individuals reported being contacted by a Twitter representative to discuss the abuse they reported. “Safety is our top priority” On Sept. 15, Twitter declined BuzzFeed News’ request for an executive interview on the subject of harassment. In response to a Sept. 19 letter detailing the findings of our survey, Twitter’s head of communications, Kristin Binns, provided the following comment: “Safety is our top priority  —   we’re building better tools and processes every day. We can’t comment on a   survey, and its anonymous nature makes it impossible to verify data or corroborate response. While we know there’s still much to be done, we’re making progress toward giving people more control over their Twitter experience and to better combat abuse. ” Of our 2, 702 respondents, 1, 478 (55%) said they had been the target of an abusive tweet or Twitter direct message. Of those who answered yes, 18% said they had been harassed in just the past week, while 26% said they had been harassed at some point within the past month, but not the past week. Examples of harassment from those surveyed frequently appeared to violate Twitter’s rules, which prohibit tweets involving violent threats, harassment, and hateful conduct. Twitter’s rules explicitly state that one may not “threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease. ” Some examples  —   which were submitted anonymously to BuzzFeed News via our survey  —   include: As the above examples demonstrate, respondents of the BuzzFeed News survey reported experiencing a broad spectrum of targeted abuse on Twitter. Over 67% of respondents described the tweets they received as misogynistic in nature. Nearly 30% reported being targeted with homophobic slurs.   said they’d been subjected to racist epithets,   reported death threats, and   reported tweets encouraging them to kill themselves.. Nearly 20% of respondents reported being threatened with rape another 20% said they’d received tweets threatening to publish their private information, photos, or videos. While the examples vary in frequency and severity, the trauma of abuse in combination with Twitter’s response as described above has created a growing feeling of futility among BuzzFeed News survey respondents. “[Twitter] can be presented with multiple examples of a user violating [terms of service] and STILL say the account broke no rules,” one wrote. “It’s disheartening. You feel utterly vulnerable. I’ve never been so afraid to upset the wrong person. ” “They care more about copyrights than they do about people. ” “Twitter claims to be balancing concerns for free speech with comfort of users, but the fear of harassment   …     or even worse, doxxing routinely causes me to ” one wrote. Another respondent agreed: “In essence, Twitter’s protection of hate speech in the guise of free speech infringes on my own free speech. ” The   effect can create a culture of fear for frequent harassment targets like women and people of color. “While I personally haven’t been harassed, I HEAVILY censor what I say on Twitter because I’ve seen how abusive people are towards women there,” one respondent wrote. Other respondents suggested that Twitter’s harassment problem is systemic and worsening. “Having been on Twitter since it started, I have seen a drastic change in the past year, especially in terms of harassment. It has become ‘normal,’ almost the purpose of the platform itself,” one wrote. “There seems to be absolutely no way to take action against it. Reporting used to have some impact, lately I don’t even get responses to reports,” said another. Particularly frustrating for users is Twitter’s penchant for quickly taking down content that violates copyright for its media partners. This summer, victims of Twitter abuse criticized the network for suspending accounts posting   content without permission while not responding to their claims of user abuse. “[Twitter] took down a video I posted about the Olympics about 12 hours after I published it. But it has never taken down a harmful tweet or an account reported by me,” one respondent said about the apparent double standard. “They can delete accounts sharing broadcast content in minutes, but abusers are rarely if ever sanctioned, and almost never banned,” a second surveyed user wrote. Others surveyed were more blunt: “How much money do I need to have to protect myself and my friends? Olympics money? NBC money? Taylor Swift money?” And: “They care more about copyrights than they do about people. ” Though the hundreds of written responses collected by BuzzFeed News vary, a majority of those surveyed expressed concerns about Twitter’s internal commitment to abuse and to the platform’s average,   users. For many surveyed, years of inaction have led to a lack of trust on behalf of victims of harassment and an expectation that the problem, now systemic, will never be resolved. “The only thing I get from reporting people is the knowledge that I took an action to stop it,” one user told BuzzFeed News. “I don’t expect anything back from Twitter anymore, they don’t care. ” Another respondent suggested that “[harassment is] just clearly something that Twitter has grown to tolerate, despite what they might say, which is wrong and it only fuels hate. ” While a third summed up their experience by saying, “I constantly feel disrespected by Twitter, as they ignore threats made against me, but have the resources to support me. ” “I love Twitter and won’t leave, but many others just can’t carry on with the abuse they get. ” Despite the vitriol, some respondents still expressed affection for the platform. “I love and use Twitter every day, since 2010, but I definitely have never thought that Twitter has taken harassment seriously,” one respondent wrote. Others are worried that the lack of improvement could lead to the eventual silencing of some of Twitter’s most vital members. “It’s out of control and delegitimizing Twitter as a channel. I don’t want to lose the diversity of voices, but can’t imagine some people staying on the platform given how they are treated. It has also allowed racism and misogyny somehow become openly tolerated. ” Repeat abuse victims are left with a bitter choice: stay and be repeatedly targeted or leave the network and all the connections behind. As Ellis noted, the decision to leave is not only a victory for Twitter’s most vile communities, but also effectively silences the voices of some of its marginalized users. And in cases where Twitter is vital to the the jobs and   of others, it is a painful alienation. “It sucks having to choose between feeling safe  avoiding vitriol w the ugliness of rape, vs keeping social connections that matter to me,” Ellis tweeted after Twitter rejected her abuse reports on the grounds that her harasser did not violate the company’s rules. For Twitter, which has long struggled with user growth issues, its failure to handle abuse reports could drive away some of its most passionate power users. “It’s ruining the platform,” one survey respondent noted. “I love Twitter and won’t leave but many others just can’t carry on with the abuse they get. ” You’ll find full responses to our survey below.",

    "text": "A University of Michigan student filed a breach of contract lawsuit Wednesday against the man she said raped her in an attempt to keep him from returning to the Ann Arbor campus. The man  —   who would have been a senior  —   wants to be readmitted to the school. He filed a federal lawsuit earlier this month against several university employees arguing that his due process was violated during the university’s investigation into the sexual assault report. He said there was a conflict of interest that affected the outcome of the investigation. The woman filed her lawsuit Wednesday in Washtenaw County Circuit Court, accusing the man of sexual assault and battery, and breach of contract. The man’s suit was filed in the federal court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The lawsuits stem from a January 2016 incident at the man’s University of Michigan fraternity house. The man and woman were both drinking, and the woman said in her lawsuit that she was incapacitated. The woman said the fraternity brother raped her he maintains the sex was consensual. The woman reported the incident to university officials, who, after an investigation, found there was insufficient evidence to prove the man violated the school’s sexual misconduct policy, according to court documents. The man’s lawsuit said a university investigator, who is a former ACLU lawyer, concluded that after a   investigation that included interviews with 23 witnesses that the man had not violated the university’s sexual misconduct policy. The woman appealed the decision, which was ultimately overturned. But the man’s lawyer, Deborah Gordon, said there was a conflict of interest with the appeals panel. In the lawsuit the man filed to return to campus, he said that David Baum, an assistant dean of University of Michigan’s law school, who was on the appeals panel, did not disclose that he knows both the woman’s lawyer, Sarah Prescott, and her husband JJ, who is at the law school. The lawsuit said that Baum “likely could not be impartial” because he and JJ Prescott have worked together closely on academic affairs, served on law school committees together and fundraised together. Additionally, the lawsuit said there was also a conflict of interest with the female student’s lawyer, Prescott, because she lectured at the law school while Baum was the assistant dean. “This was a conflict or perceived conflict of interest,” Gordon, the man’s lawyer, told BuzzFeed News. “There’s no reason for him to sit on this case” Prescott denied there was a conflict of interest in an interview with BuzzFeed News. “There’s nothing to these claims and allegations,” she said, adding that Gordon “won’t be able to show anything other than that. ” Prescott  —   who at one point used to work for Gordon  —   said that she and the panelist in question have never socialized and have only met in a professional capacity. “[Gordon] knows the extent of our relationship,” Prescott said. Baum did not immediately respond to request for comment. Gordon told BuzzFeed News she brought up the conflict of interest issue to the university, requesting a new appeal hearing, but was denied. “We have confidence in the decision reached by the appeals panel and we will respond through the appropriate court filings,” a university spokesperson said in a statement about the man’s lawsuit. The spokesperson refused to comment on the woman’s lawsuit. Following the appeal panel’s decision finding him guilty, the man was offered a resolution agreement, which would allow him to permanently withdraw from the university rather than being expelled. For the agreement to be valid, the woman would have to sign it as well, giving up her right to advocate for a harsher punishment. The man is now suing to return to the University of Michigan to complete his senior year. His reputation and career prospects have been irreparably harmed, according to his lawsuit, which added he will not be able to accept a lucrative   job offer with a financial institution contingent on him graduating from the University of Michigan. “I came back to campus determined to put last semester’s   tragedy and the personal impact of the investigation behind me,” the woman said in a statement. “The trauma he caused is now a part of me, but I will never let it define me. I will continue to fight not to let him back on campus. ”",

    "text": "Brad Pitt is “fully cooperating” with an investigation into allegations that he verbally and physically abused one of his children, a source close to the actor told BuzzFeed News on Thursday. The source did not say which agency was conducting the investigation. People magazine and TMZ reported that the LA County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) was investigating allegations that Pitt got “verbally abusive” and “physical” with one of his children while on a private plane with Angelina Jolie and their other kids on Sept. 14. “He takes the matter very seriously,” the source told BuzzFeed News. “He is fully cooperating and will always do what is best for his children. ” The complaint also said he was allegedly inebriated at the time, People reported. The DCFS reportedly began its investigation after someone anonymously reported the incident that allegedly occurred on the tarmac where the couple’s private jet had landed. The   private plane traveling from France landed in the Minneapolis area on Sept. 14. Citing a source, People reported that the DCFS case was ongoing and “remains open. ” Pitt’s representative declined to comment and referred BuzzFeed News to the statement the actor made Tuesday after Jolie filed for divorce: “I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the wellbeing of our kids. I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time. ” TMZ reported that the Los Angeles Police Department was also investigating the allegations of child abuse. However, the LAPD told BuzzFeed News that the TMZ report was wrong and the department was not handling “any report or [investigating] any allegations into child abuse against Mr. Brad Pitt. ” “Brad has always worked hard to be a good father and will do whatever is best for his family,” the source close to the actor told BuzzFeed News. FBI Minnesota office also denied reports that a case involving Pitt was referred to their office. A spokeswoman for the FBI field office in Los Angeles, meanwhile, told BuzzFeed News that the agency “is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued. ”",

    "text": "Nearly 14, 000 Uber and Lyft drivers in New York have signed up to join the local branch of the Amalgamated Transit Union, according to a union spokesperson. The group plans to rally at the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) headquarters next week to demand a formal vote on unionizing. The 14, 000   exceed the 30 percent threshold that federal regulators say must trigger an official vote, the union says. The cards signed by drivers indicate that they seek ATU membership and authorize the union to act as their collective bargaining agent. In May, Uber struck a deal with the International Association of Machinists and the independent Freelancers Union to form a new Independent Drivers Guild that would represent their workers. While not an official union, the Guild is open to the 35, 000 drivers Uber says it employs in New York. As a condition of the agreement to form the Guild, the Machinists union promised not to try to formally unionize Uber drivers for five years both the ATU and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers have been actively trying to unionize Uber drivers since last winter. Uber maintains its drivers are independent contractors, not employees, and therefore do not have the right to unionize, although recent legislation in Seattle affirmed their right to do so. The ATU’s Local   branch is the largest chapter of the ATU, representing more than 14, 000 transit workers including drivers and mechanics throughout New York City, Westchester, and Long Island. The   Amalgamated Transit Union represents city and school bus drivers, subway and ferry operators, mechanics and maintenance workers, among others in the U. S. and Canada. Drivers will rally at the TLC headquarters in Long Island City on Tuesday, September 27, at 11AM.",

A “quote” of mine was released yesterday causing my phone to blow up by friends, family and even both candidates’ camps, so I want to explain the context in which I said I was “on the fence” about my vote. There was a point when I wasn’t 100% sure I was even going to vote in this election I didn’t want to vote blindly. But I also thought about how not voting would mean that I wasn’t making my voice heard, so I decided to talk to my closest friends and family who I love and trust, to have an open conversation about politics. I believe we owe it to ourselves, and to each other, to ask questions. To do our research so that we vote for the candidate who represents our own beliefs. We should start at a place of openness, receptiveness and honesty, and we should talk to those we love, trust and respect. I had a long conversation with Caitlyn, who has always been open about her political views, and she encouraged me to do my research before making my decision and then vote for the candidate whose policies aligned with the things that matter most to me. And so that’s what I did. I thought about the things that are so important to me that they outweigh everything else, such as gun control and protecting women’s rights to safe and legal abortion. I found that without a doubt, I stand with Hillary. I’m with her. I believe Hillary will best represent our country and is the most qualified for the job. This year, I’m not just voting for myself, but also for my children, and I took that into careful consideration when I made my decision. Now that I have made my choice I want to be clear  …     I would never judge anyone based on their political or religious beliefs. I believe that both candidates have the intention of making the country a safer and stronger place for every American, they just have different ideas about how we get there. God bless America for allowing us to even make these decisions  —   there are so many in this world who are not so privileged. \t\t\tThis post has been updated to include the fact that the quote in question appeared in a preview version of the Wonderland article sent to select press and that BuzzFeed News has contacted a publicist for the publication.\t\t\t \t\t\tThis post has been updated with Kim Kardashian’s statement on her website.",

More than 100 people tried to convene on a beach in Entebbe on Lake Victoria but were ordered back into their minibuses by police and told to leave the area, human rights lawyer Nicholas Opiyo told BuzzFeed News. “The police arrived at the venue before the event organizers,” Opiyo said. After being blocked at the first location, dozens of others were prevented by police from holding a second parade at another location, Kisubu beach. One woman, Kasha Jacqueline Nabagesera, refused to leave the public beach, so police towed her car, Opiyo said. Enjoy, LGBT leader Frank Mugisha told Agence   that one man jumped from a moving minibus and injured himself. “They are traumatized,” he said.

Lokodo said the parade was designed to promote homosexuality to young people. “We are aware that there are inducements, including money, being offered to young people to promote the practice,” he said. Lawyer Nicholas Opiyo said he believed the minister was unaware that parade organizers had formally notified police of their intention to hold a public gathering. “In terms of the legal procedure, they ticked all the boxes,” he said. Pride parades have been held in Uganda for the past few years without incident, after the country’s constitutional court overturned an   law in 2014. However, organizers canceled a pride parade in August after a meeting between Opiyo and Minister Lokodo. “We decided to suspend it because of the risks to personal safety,” Opiyo told BuzzFeed News in August. “The minister threatened to mobilize a mob and a large police group to beat up anyone who shows up for pride. ” Also in August, police raided a transgender pageant in Kampala, detaining several   activists, including Mugisha, before releasing them without charge.",

    "text": "Jeremy Corbyn has called for a new unity in the Labour party after he secured a convincing victory over Owen Smith to retain leadership. His declaration follows a brutal contest which put further strain on the already deep divisions within the Labour party. Corbyn thanked Smith for a summer of “  debate” which he said he hopes to continue with his leadership rival. “We’re part of the same Labour family and that’s how it’s always going to be,” Corbyn said as Smith nodded from the audience. “Our Labour family is facing the future and how we do things together in the future,” Corbyn continued, pledging to “do everything I can to repay trust and the support, to bring our party together” and to “win power to deliver real change”. Corbyn acknowledged that elections could be “passionate and often partisan affairs” and that those on all sides say things “we sometimes later come to regret” in the heat of debate. “But always remember in our party we have much more in common than that which divides us,” he continued. “As far as I’m concerned let’s wipe that slate clean today and get on with the work that we’ve got to do as a party together. ” The Labour leader’s victory was announced at a special meeting of the party in Liverpool on Saturday, the day before the party’s annual conference gets underway. Corbyn won 61. 8% of the vote, against Owen Smith’s 38. 2%. An enormous 506, 438 people voted in the election, with Corbyn winning a higher percentage of the vote than the 59. 5% he took in the September 2015 leadership election, Just ten months after that result he faced a formal challenge from Labour MPs who had become increasingly convinced he could not lead the party to victory at the next general election. While Corbyn’s 2015 victory was one of the most unexpected victories in recent British political history, the outcome of this summer’s contest was never truly in doubt. Although the overwhelmingly majority of the parliamentary Labour party backed challenger Owen Smith, the result of the     month campaign shows the majority of Labour activists were more than happy with the current leader. Corbyn won among every single category of voter eligible to take part in the election. He won 59% of the votes from the 285, 176 full Labour party members and 69. 9% of the votes from 121, 517 people who paid £25 to become a registered Labour party supporter. Of the 99, 745 people who registered as affiliated Labour supporters through organisations such as trade unions, Corbyn won 60. 2% of the votes. While the result leaves Corbyn’s leadership in its strongest position yet, he now faces the enormous challenge of putting back together the two rival factions of his party and attempting to rebuild his shadow cabinet. Smith said he was committed to the party but would be taking a break from frontline politics: “I have no time for talk of a split in the Labour movement  —   it’s Labour or nothing for me. ” “Above all, despite present divisions, we have to stick together in for the long term. I call on those party members disappointed by the result and tempted to look elsewhere to stay with Labour and to stay involved. Let’s work together to renew this movement and take the fight to the Tories. Shadow home secretary and Greater Manchester mayoral candidate Andy Burnham, who remained neutral in the contest, also called on his fellow Labour MPs to “come back and serve” in order to become a more “effective opposition” in government. Shadow cabinet member Jon Ashworth MP told BuzzFeed News that the focus had to be on accepting the result: “Jeremy Corbyn has won. We’ve got really important elections next year where we’ve got to show that we’re unified. ” He also urged Corbyn to back a proposal  —   due to be discussed on Saturday evening  —   to allow Labour MPs to elect the shadow cabinet, which would provide a way back to the frontbench for prominent Labour MPs who feel unable to serve under Corbyn. “If people want to get more colleagues to serve on the front bench we need elections,” said Ashworth. The majority of Labour MPs are on record as publicly opposing Corbyn’s leadership and although he has promised to offer jobs to his critics, some of the party’s most prominent names are unlikely to return to the front bench. Some of those who publicly opposed Corbyn are fearful of deselections. Many remain convinced that he is not a suitable leader for their party. However, there is little chance of the party formally splitting in the near future. Instead,   MPs are now focussing their efforts on campaigning for a return to a system where the shadow cabinet is elected by Labour MPs rather than chosen by the party leader. While Corbyn held rallies across the UK which attracted tens of thousands of supporters, Smith struggled to either set out a clear vision of where he wanted to take Labour or attract the support required. Instead, he based his pitch around being a more electable version of Corbyn. Ultimately, he found there simply wasn’t the support within the party membership for such a change.",

    "text": "’Read the Alabama Supreme Court’s Ruling:’] Alabama’s Supreme Court unanimously upheld the state’s death penalty sentencing scheme on Friday, nine months after the U. S. Supreme Court struck down a similar system in Florida. In January, the high court ruled in Hurst v. Florida that the state’s sentencing law was unconstitutional because it relied on “a judge’s factfinding” and not “a jury’s verdict” to sentence a person to death. On Friday, the eight sitting judges of the Alabama Supreme Court said its law was sufficiently different, that it remains constitutional  —   addressing the issue in a challenge brought by Jerry Bohannon, convicted of murder in 2011. “[B]ecause in Alabama a jury, not the judge, determines by a unanimous verdict the critical finding that an aggravating circumstance exists beyond a reasonable doubt to make a defendant   Alabama’s   scheme does not violate the Sixth Amendment,” Justice Lyn Stuart wrote for the court wrote. “Moreover, Hurst does not address the process of weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances or suggest that the jury must conduct the weighing process to satisfy the Sixth Amendment. ” Six of the remaining seven justices on the court (Chief Justice Roy Moore has been suspended from office) joined Stuart’s ruling. The final justice, Justice Glenn Murdock, agreed with the result of the case  —   affirming Bohannon’s death sentence  —   but did not join in Stuart’s opinion. Last month, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled that its death penalty law was unconstitutional, citing Hurst. This is a developing news story. Please check back at BuzzFeed News for more.",

Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and    twins Vivienne and Knox will remain in Jolie’s care until Oct. 20. The plan was proposed by the Department of Children Family Services (DCFS) the agency that is currently investigating the welfare of the children after an alleged incident on Sept. 14 between Pitt and one of his children while aboard a jet. Pitt’s camp has insisted from the start that there was no inappropriate physical contact or altercation. Five days after the alleged plane incident, Jolie filed for divorce and requested sole physical custody of their six children. Per the current agreement, Pitt and Jolie voluntarily agreed to get individual counseling. Pitt also agreed to voluntarily participate in drug and alcohol testing, and visits with his children will be monitored by a therapist, sources close to the couple told BuzzFeed News. “The supervised visits with the therapist are to deal with some of the trauma the kids have been through,” one source, who spoke on the condition they not be identified, said. DCFS officials plan to reassess the custody situation and might make other stipulations or parenting suggestions on Oct. 20. “DCFS gets involved if they believe there is enough concern about physical abuse or even emotional abuse,” said Beatrice Fung, an attorney who practices in children’s court and who is not affiliated in the   case. It typically takes 30 days for DCFS to complete their investigation, but the agency usually suggests an interim “safety plan” be put in place during that time, Fung added. “A lot of times when the department has not concluded their investigation, or is not ready to close out the referral, they will put a safety plan in place and ask if the parents will agree to the safety plan,” Fung said. Parents are not required to agree to the plan, but if they don’t, it might prompt DCFS to escalate the matter to a court case quicker than if they had been given the opportunity to finish their investigation, she added. DCFS officials have not responded to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment. Jolie still intends to seek sole custody. Pitt maintains he is committed to doing what is best for his children and, according to an earlier statement, is hopeful for “an amicable and private resolution for everyone’s benefit. ”",

    "text": "’Read the order:’] WASHINGTON  —   Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore has been suspended from office without pay from the remainder of his term, the fallout from his action of telling probate judges in the state that they were not bound by federal court rulings guaranteeing equal marriage rights to   couples. A   body responsible for hearing judicial ethics complaints in Alabama unanimously found Moore guilty of all of the ethics charges brought against him, finding that he violated multiple judicial ethics canons by his actions. The suspension, the Court of the Judiciary ordered, is effective immediately. The move, lawyers on both sides of the matter say, is effectively the same as removal from office  —   the second time Moore has had his judicial authority taken away from him. Moore previously was removed from office in 2003 when he refused to follow a federal court’s order that he remove a display of the Ten Commandments from the courtroom. Additionally, under state rules, Moore is not be eligible to run for another term as chief justice due to his age  —   although there is speculation that Moore could try, again, to run for governor of the state. “There is no meaningful difference between suspension for the remaining of the term and removal from office,” Mat Staver, Moore’s lawyer from Liberty Counsel, said in a statement. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which filed an ethics complaint against Moore based on his handling of marriage issues, concurred with Staver’s assessment. “As a practical matter, there is no difference” between removal and suspension for the remainder of his term, SPLC president Richard Cohen said. Moore, throughout the judicial fights over   couples’ marriage rights, had used his role as the administrative head of the state courts to direct probate judges to follow Alabama’s constitutional ban on   couples’ marriages. Even after the 2015 ruling of the U. S. Supreme Court ending marriage bans and a federal court order applying that decision to Alabama’s ban directly, Moore issued an order on Jan. 6, 2016, telling probate judges that prior state court orders supporting the state’s marriage ban remained in effect. Complaints filed regarding that order led the state’s Judicial Inquiry Commission to begin an investigation, ending with the filing of a complaint against Moore in May. The Court of the Judiciary heard the complaint, with the   body unanimously finding Moore guilty of all six charges brought against him. One distinction between Moore being suspended for the remainder of his term and removed from office is that a suspension leads only to the naming of an acting chief justice, not the potential for Gov. Robert Bentley  —   facing his own crisis in office  —   to put forth his own appointment to the court. “From the key point of whether [Moore] can exercise judicial authority, there is no difference,” Cohen said, “and that was our aim. ” Moore has been suspended from sitting on the bench since the filing of the complaint against him in May.",

    "text": "NEW YORK  —   Michelle Bachelet, the president of Chile, admits that she’s biased when it comes to the US election. “We’ve developed a good friendship,” Bachelet told BuzzFeed News in an interview, referring to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. “I think she’s a great woman, very capable, intelligent, and very committed. I think that we need more female presidents in the world. ” “I am sorry for being biased, I have to say,” she said with a laugh. Bachelet’s first term as president of Chile overlapped with Hillary Clinton’s time as Secretary of State, though the two first met in 2005, when Clinton was a Senator and Bachelet was campaigning. (During Clinton’s first bid for president in 2008, she penned Bachelet’s entry on the annual “Time 100” list.) The two worked closely together during that time, Bachelet said, and continued after she was appointed the executive director of the newly created UN Women in 2010. After stepping down from the UN, Bachelet won her bid to return to office in 2014. Though she was Chile’s first woman president, Bachelet says she hasn’t given Clinton any specific advice on how to deflect sexism on the campaign trail or once in office. “In all countries there’s a lot of misogyny and sexism still, and in the campaign some of those things have been used against Hillary,” she said, adding if she were to give Clinton advice, it would be to follow through on her campaign commitments and “to make sure any policy you develop as president is  . ” And as for the other side of the US ballot? “I don’t personally know Donald Trump,” Bachelet said. “I’ve read his declarations on many issues, and of course in Latin America   …     people feel ‘what is the relationship with Latin America’ should he win?” “I would want that the president of the US would be someone who is friendly and would respect countries and civilities,” she said. Bachelet was in New York for the UN General Assembly. The global body is due to elect a new   in the coming months and there have been calls for the body to finally appoint a woman for the first time in its   history. Male candidates, however, appear to be leading the race, which is just beginning to solidify. Bachelet declined to jump into the fray. “We have a lot of great women running as candidates, and we have a lot of great men running,” she said, noting that straw polls that will give a better sense of the race are still yet to come. Bachelet, 64, is too nearing the end of her presidential term, her second, with her approval ratings dwindling to around 15% in recent polls. A series of corruption scandals, including tax evasion charges against her    Natalia Compagnon, and setbacks to her education and pension reforms, have dogged her administration. That has made it difficult to push forward her goals in the legislature, even though her   coalition has a majority. That includes initiatives to decriminalize abortion in certain cases, including those of rape and the health of the mother  —   a position Bachelet claimed to BuzzFeed News that 70% of her population agrees with her on  —   and legalize marriage equality. Bachelet said she has a “personal conviction that women should have the chance and not go to jail by decided they want to interrupt a pregnancy” that meets certain conditions. “I do believe that women should have sexual reproductive rights. ” Regarding LGBT issues in Chile  —   which drew international attention after the brutal murder of a    gay man in 2012, prompting the adoption of an   bill and the eventual introduction of civil unions  —   Bachelet said that it is becoming “increasingly clear that a family is a family. ” On Wednesday while speaking at the UN, she announced that she’d be pushing forward legislation to provide full marriage equality to LGBT couples. “I believe we need to expand people’s rights,” she told BuzzFeed News, “and LGBT people have to have the same rights as everyone. ” Bachelet said she would push ahead with those initiatives despite her dwindling popularity. “I don’t lead the country thinking on my popularity,” Bachelet said. “I lead the country according to the promises I made and the commitments I took with people during the election, and they voted for that. ”",

    "text": "NEW YORK  —   The outgoing president of Estonia warned against the “naïveté” of other European leaders when dealing with an increasingly aggressive Russia, in an interview with BuzzFeed News. President Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who leaves office next month after holding the presidency for 10 years, stressed that Russia poses a threat to Europe by funding   parties and undermining   security agreements. “We cannot count on Russia to stick to fundamental agreements regarding Western security,” said Ilves, who is in New York for the United Nations General Assembly. “Sometimes I’m bewildered by the naïveté of some leaders who, having seen repeatedly that all of this is violated, still persist in sort of acting as if we have not   …     seen the intentional undermining of the foundations of Western security. ” He pointed to those countries, like France, who supported ending sanctions on Russia, put in place after the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea and bloody meddling in eastern Ukraine. Ilves, along with other Baltic leaders, has long warned of increasing Russian interference. He said he believed, however, that the Baltic countries were not at the top of Moscow’s priority list, as it becomes ever more interventionist abroad, from Ukraine to Syria. “I think [the threats] are relatively low because no one really wants to test Article 5,” he said, referring to the section of NATO’s founding treaty that compels members to come to one another’s defense. The larger threat, Ilves said, lies with countries that are, unlike Estonia, neither members of the European Union nor NATO. Europe is facing an intense set of challenges, from Russian support for populist parties, to the continuing refugee crisis and the aftershocks of Brexit. Ilves said one of the greatest concerns around Brexit was the key role the United Kingdom played in bolstering the transatlantic relationship. “As long as the UK is in the EU, it can temper some of the   positions that we see some countries taking,” Ilves said. “But let’s be honest, the sole   link, the big link to Europe that the United States has is through NATO. ” The Baltic countries are among the loudest critics of the idea of an “EU army,” as Latvian President Raimonds Vējonis told BuzzFeed News on Monday, in part because of their belief in the primacy of NATO. When asked if he was concerned that the series of threats facing the EU could undermine its existence, Ilves turned the question around: “When I sit there in Europe and read what one of your presidential candidates says, I think, is the United States going to exist?” “Perhaps not that dire but, nonetheless, the degree of polarization on all kinds of issues in the US is something,” he said. “And where, in fact, the fundamentals of the past 70 years are being called into question then I could equally say the same thing. ” Donald Trump, aside from his general bombastic and unpredictable policy statements and approaches, raised concerns across Europe when he said he would set conditions  —   that is, fully meeting defense spending commitments  —   in order to invoke NATO’s full protection of its members. (Ilves said at the time that he was unconcerned, since Estonia is one of the few countries to pay its full dues.) Ilves said he enjoyed a “good relationship” with President Barack Obama, who gave a major foreign policy speech in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, in September 2014. “We’ve gotten what we wanted,” Ilves said. “Initially, we wanted something as basic as even contingency plans for the defense of the Baltic countries, which was not on the table or didn’t exist, when we’d been members in NATO for six years. ” “NATO was still in its sort of     mode  —   ‘You don’t need contingency plans, nothing is gonna happen’ the US was strongly behind doing those,” he said. He also recalled how, in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014, the US poured its support behind the expansion of the Ämari Air Base, where some NATO planes are stationed, including US Air Force jets, as part of a Baltic   mission. “We had been asking for years,” said Ilves, and received replies like ‘You don’t need it, you don’t need it. ’” “We requested it early the first Monday morning after the Crimea annexation  —   our defense minister went into the US embassy and said, ‘We really would like to have you here,’ and within three days they were. ” “No sort of, ‘Oh, we have to go do this, and discuss that’  —   I mean, it came,” he said. “We’re not complaining. ” With just three weeks left in his term, the president  —   who grew up in New Jersey and served as foreign minister before taking the helm of the country  —   has begun to look ahead. He says he will take his first vacation in 11 years and then “continue to work,” though he won’t detail how. Though his first response, when asked what he planned to do after he leaves office, was this: “I found a great term” on this internet this morning, he said. “This is what life will be after three weeks. The word is ‘unfuckwithable’ and the definition is: ‘When you’re truly at peace and in touch with yourself, nothing anyone says or does bothers you and no negativity can touch you. ’” Asked if he had any parting words for the US presidential candidates he said, “It’s for someone else, but: We’re not a suburb of St. Petersburg. ”",

    "text": "NEW YORK  —   The European Union does not need its own army, Latvian President Raimonds Vējonis told BuzzFeed News, jumping into a debate that has split Europe’s leaders. “I have been a minister of defense, and I can say my personal opinion is that we don’t need a European army,” Vējonis said during an interview on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. “We need to strengthen our national armies, yes. Because the largest part of EU countries are NATO members, we are investing a lot in [the] strengthening and development of our national armies. ” Discussion of an EU army has revived since the United Kingdom, which stood against a more integrated defense policy, voted to leave the European Union. On Sept. 8, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini revealed a new set of plans to move the idea forward, including establishing a headquarters in Brussels to coordinate future and present military and civilian actions and utilizing   units more. Mogherini, who has insisted that her proposals don’t constitute an EU army, said that   there is a “general consensus on the need to move forward in this field. ” Latvian officials, including the foreign minister and prime minister, and those of other former Soviet states have been skeptical, fearing the European initiative would compete with NATO  —   the military alliance they rely on, particularly at a time when Russia is resurgent. “The situation in Ukraine opened the eyes of many leaders of countries, not only in the EU but the whole world,” Vējonis said, referring to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014. Vējonis, who has been president since July 2015, said the US had been a “driving force” in responding to the Ukraine crisis and provided the first soldiers to help shore up Latvia’s defenses, deploying 150 soldiers to each of the three Baltic states. The US has been criticized for not doing enough to aid Ukraine in responding to the   rebels in its east and assuage the worries of other countries that fell within Russia’s sphere of influence during the Cold War. In March, NATO leaders agreed to station up to 4, 000 troops in the Baltics and eastern Poland. Russia has particularly tried to stoke   populations around the former Soviet Union, including through propaganda directed at them. Vējonis dismissed that concern, however, saying of Latvia’s   minority, which numbers 200, 000 in a country of 1. 9 million: “They are very loyal. ” Vējonis also said the refugee crisis posed a challenge to the country: “I think it’s not necessary to establish a special European army, but at the same time we have to work together to strengthen the borders of our EU,” particularly on the union’s southern border, which saw the brunt of refugee arrivals. Vējonis declined to comment directly on the US election but did allude to one of the most controversial statements made by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who threatened to not come to the aid of NATO countries who didn’t pay their dues. While not explicitly linking to Trump’s statement, Vējonis was quick to highlight his country’s commitment to achieving the 2% of GDP spending on defense target that NATO countries have previously agreed upon. “All NATO member states, and all EU members states who are part of NATO, must follow this goal,” he said. Republican candidate Donald Trump, who has implied that the United States would not help a NATO ally in need should it not reach its GDP spending goals, would need to adhere to the terms of NATO if he was elected, Vējonis said. “We believe that any leader who will be elected   …     any leader who will lead the US must follow already agreed things,” he said. “We signed this agreement, we ratified this agreement, it means we must follow responsibly all points, to all articles in this agreement, because we are serious countries. ” But when asked if there was any fear at all that Trump would attempt to remove the US from the North Atlantic Treaty, which set up NATO, Vējonis hedged. “It’s difficult to say,” he responded.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON  —   Allies of Donald Trump have a new line in the days since the debate: that Trump is a paragon of graciousness for not attacking Hillary Clinton on the debate stage for her husband’s affairs. Trump himself got the ball rolling moments after the debate, telling CNN in the spin room that “I’m very happy I was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton. Because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton, and I didn’t want to say what I was going to say” and then threatening to bring it up next time. And from there, the people around Trump have followed in his stead. His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway mentioned his omitting the topic later in the spin room and on television. His son Eric said in a radio interview that it had taken “courage” for his father to not bring the issue up and that it would be “something I’ll always remember. ” Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn brought up Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers, and Monica Lewinsky in an MSNBC interview. Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge also said on MSNBC that “If we want to dig back through the ‘90s on comments made about women, we can certainly look to Secretary Clinton referring to Monica Lewinsky as a neurotic loony toon. ” And in another MSNBC interview, Rep. Chris Collins also criticized Hillary Clinton for allegedly mistreating the women with whom Bill Clinton cheated. (In correspondence brought to light by the Free Beacon two years ago, Clinton was reported by friend Diane Blair to have referred to Lewinsky as a “narcissistic loony toon” in private.) Rudy Giuliani has taken the line of attack one step further by referring to Clinton as “too stupid to be president” because of her husband’s affairs. It’s unclear to what extent the surrogates are simply following the public lead of the candidate and top staff, or whether they have received instructions. One person close to a Trump surrogate who made some of the comments said that they had not received talking points. Asked if the campaign has been sending out talking points to surrogates on this topic, Conway said in an email to BuzzFeed News, “I’ve personally seen no talkers to that extent (they may exist because I don’t use talkers normally) so it may be freelancing. ” “It is something I said immediately after the debate in the spin   TV, and have repeated privately and publicly since. Restraint is a presidential virtue,” Conway said. Trump showed “admirable restraint and grace because we knew she would attack him about women,” Conway said. Coming out of the debate, both sides are jostling each other for the favor of independent and even some Republican women, a voting bloc Trump desperately needs. Women with college degrees have been especially   and Clinton is attempting to further lock down that segment by highlighting Trump’s own issues with women. The Clinton campaign has also been promoting the story of Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe whom Trump publicly shamed for her weight back in the 1990s and who has told interviewers (in two interviews that came out very quickly after the debate, though the interviewers say the release was not coordinated with the Clinton campaign) that she was scarred by the experience. Trump’s making sure to mention his not mentioning Bill Clinton’s sex scandals is a coy way of mentioning them. The strategy is the Trump side’s own attempt to not only   the Clinton scandals of the 1990s, but to appeal to women by casting Clinton as a betrayer of women. “The issue is not simply that Bill Clinton cheated on Hillary numerous times throughout their marriage. The issue is how Hillary Clinton treated the women in her husband’s life. She attacked them. Some of them have said their lives were ruined,” Conway contended. Trump told CNN in the spin room that he would possibly bring up Bill Clinton’s infidelities in the next debate, though if, as he stated, Chelsea Clinton’s attendance is the condition for him to not raise the issue, that could hamper him. “I don’t remember a time in my life when my parents and my family weren’t being attacked, and so it just sort of seems to be in that tradition, unfortunately,” Chelsea Clinton said in an interview with Cosmopolitan on Wednesday in regard to Trump’s raising the specter of her father’s cheating. By turning the focus to Bill Clinton’s infidelity, Trump also runs the risk of opening himself up to criticism for his own marital history, which includes having left his first wife Ivana Trump for second wife Marla Maples after having an affair with Maples. And, historically, Hillary Clinton’s popularity was actually highest in the wake of the Lewinsky scandal.",

    "text": "’ Watch Trump’s full comments here. ’] On Fox and Friends, Trump responded to Clinton’s comments about the way he speaks about women and his past comments about 1996 Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado.  According to Trump, Machado “was the winner and she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. ” Clinton said during the debate that “one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them, and he called this woman ‘Miss Piggy,’ then he called her ‘Miss Housekeeping’ because she was Latina. ” “Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado,” Clinton said, “and she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November. ” After the debate, Clinton tweeted a video of Machado talking about Trump and her experience in the Miss Universe pageant. Donald Trump called her ”Miss Piggy” and ”Miss Housekeeping. ”Her name is Alicia Machado. #DebateNight, The former Miss Universe winner added that Trump yelled at her all the time, and often told her “You look ugly” or “You look fat. ”  In Clinton’s tweeted video, Machado said, “Sometimes he’d ‘play’ with me and say ‘Hello, Miss Piggy,’ ‘Hello, Miss Housekeeping. ’” On Tuesday morning, Trump said that Machado “was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had,” adding that she was “impossible. ” He went on to say that “she was a Miss Universe contestant, and ultimately a winner, who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe. ”",

    "text": "The U. S. Department of Justice has opened an investigation into prison conditions in Alabama, weeks after inmates there joined a nationwide prisoner strike in protest of forced labor and living conditions. “The investigation will focus on whether prisoners are adequately protected from physical harm and sexual abuse at the hands of other prisoners whether prisoners are adequately protected from use of excessive force and staff sexual abuse by correctional officers and whether the prisons provide sanitary, secure and safe living conditions,” the DOJ said in a statement. The department declined to comment on what prompted the   probe. But Pastor Kenneth Glasgow, a leader of the Free Alabama Movement, an advocacy group that helped support the strike, credited the actions of prisoners and corrections officers of Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama. “I do believe the prison strike that was initiated led and organized by those on the inside of Holman prison is the reason for the DOJ launching the investigation,” he said. “And I think when they saw that even the officers admitted that the administration was allowing a hostile environment to be created, that was the straw that broke the camel’s back. ” As the prisoner strike continued in late September, corrections officers at Holman prison did not show up to scheduled work shifts and spoke out about dangerous conditions. And in Michigan, unionized corrections officers have expressed sympathy for the prisoners’ cause. “We see it as a moral issue,” said Andy Potter, Chief of Staff and Executive Vice President of the Michigan Corrections Organization, which represents 10, 000 corrections staffers. Hundreds of inmates in Michigan took part in the national strike with a peaceful   march in early September, leading to a purge by prison authorities, who identified 250 organizers of the strike and relocated them to other facilities. “The officers basically understand the prisoners’ plight,” Potter told BuzzFeed News. “They don’t outright support the   they haven’t taken a position like that, but almost everyone that I’ve talked to  —   and I represent them  —   understand why the inmates would do it. ” On the evening of Sunday, September 24th, more than two weeks after the national strike began, nine corrections officers at Holman did not show up to work their scheduled shift. Officers from nearby prisons were brought in to fill the posts, with   officers handing out meals and handling security, according to reports from prisoners in the facility. The following Sunday, six of the nine again did not appear for work, according to the Alabama Department of Corrections. While corrections officers have not officially endorsed the strike or shared specific grievances with the DOC, it was “not routine” for officers to fail to come to work in those numbers, ADOC Public Information Officer Robert Horton told BuzzFeed News. At the heart of the prison strike is the contention that forced labor is a violation of basic rights. Approximately 900, 000 of America’s 2. 4 million prisoners today work for little or no pay, both running their facilities and producing goods like license plates and furniture for the state and private companies. This is made possible by a loophole in the U. S. Constitution itself. The 13th Amendment reads, in full: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States. ” In protest of being forced to work, as well as documented patterns of overcrowding, spoiled food, and the abuse of solitary confinement, prisoners across the country began working on plans for a national prison strike more than a year ago. Using smuggled cell phones, social media, and the help of outside groups such as the Free Alabama Movement (FAM) and the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) prisoners were able to organize weeks of action beginning September 9th, the 45th anniversary of the Attica prison uprising in upstate New York. But a broad view of the national action can be hard to come by. Prisoners have limited opportunities to communicate with the outside world, and information on the strike has been sporadic and difficult to obtain. Some organizers have been placed in solitary confinement. So far, actions have been reported at facilities in Alabama, Michigan, Washington state, South Carolina, Ohio, and California over the past four weeks. Accounts from Washington state and Michigan in particular illustrate the potential consequences for prisoners who take part in the strike, and the difficulty of maintaining momentum when any form of protest is met with swift retaliation. At the Washington Corrections Center for Women in Gig Harbor, Washington on September 9th, three prisoners did not report to their jobs in the prison library, in solidarity with the nationwide strike. All three were placed in solitary confinement, pending disciplinary hearings, according to Jeremy Barclay, Communications Director of the Washington Department of Corrections. At the hearings, they were found guilty of not having appeared for work. The women were required to spend 20 days in solitary confinement for participating in the strike, and they lost their job details working the library. As a result of their actions, the prison library remained closed from Sept. 9th to Oct. 1st, Barclay said. According to the WDOC, the women were the only prisoners in the state to take part in the strike. At Kinross Correctional Facility in Kincheloe, Michigan, on Sept. 9th, four hundred prisoners marched in the yard peacefully in violation of prison rules, according to Michigan DOC Public Information Officer Chris Goutz. “After a few hours, we had our deputy wardens come out and talk to the prisoners and convince them to go back to their bunks, which they did,” he said. “We appreciated that. ” A crackdown followed. First, a “warden’s forum” was convened, during which some prisoners spoke with the prison management about their grievances. They also shared information about which prisoners had helped to organized the strike, which corrections officers had been tracking independently as well. Later that afternoon, the prison dispatched an emergency response team, who went in and “extricated those who were responsible for leading the protest,” according to Goutz. “During the time it took to remove all of those who were involved  —   150 in 8 housing units  —   some of the prisoners who could see this was happening took that time to break things in their housing units,” he said. Eventually, the officers placed all prisoners in the yard, with their wrists   for several hours, Goutz said, confirming an account from IWOC spokesperson Azzurra Crispino. In the following days, corrections officers removed the 150 prisoners identified as strike leaders from Kinross and relocated them to other facilities in the state. The prisoners were placed in solitary confinement until they could have a disciplinary hearing, after which, if found guilty, they will have sanctions placed on them in the form of lost privileges or increased security, restricting their freedom of movement, according to Goutz. During the march, the prisoners “weren’t attacking each other, attacking staff, or calling out threats to my knowledge,” Goutz said. “They were just marching. But in a prison setting, any demonstration like that, where prisoners are gathering together and acting as one, is a dangerous situation. So it’s not allowed, and the prisoners know that. ” After the removal of the initial 150 prisoners who had been involved in the strike, corrections officers identified roughly another 100 prisoners involved in the labor action, who were also removed, Goutz said. In total, 250 prisoners were moved out of the facility. No individual who could be linked to organizing the strike remains at Kinross. One of the main reasons prisoners participated in the strike in Michigan, according to the MCO’s Potter, was the low quality and quantity of food in their facilities, which corrections officers have long protested. “We’ve been in the media for the past two or three years arguing the food portions are terrible,” Potter said. “Both the quantity and the quality. It’s not right. ” According to prisoners and officers, the food is often spoiled and contains maggots. Also prior to the strike, wages for prisoners’ work were decreased, while commissary prices for packaged food were increased, Potter said. This was one of the main contributing reasons for the strike at Kinross. “Prisoners should be paid a good wage when they work,” said Potter. “They should be allowed to buy store goods. When they repress that, they create a pressure cooker situation. This didn’t just pop up out of nowhere. ” In response to the retaliation now underway in different facilities across the country, the National Lawyers Guild, which endorsed the strike back in the spring, has offered its services. “We have gotten quite a few reports from different states, from prisoners who are facing retaliation for their participation,” said Tasha Moro, Communications Director for the National Lawyers Guild. “We’ve offered to file notices of claim on their behalf, which notifies the prison that a suit could be filed, letting them know the abuse in these reports are being documented and allows prisoners time to find local representation. ” And the cause of striking prisoners may get a signal boost from the release of The 13th, a documentary on prison labor directed by Ava DuVernay, which comes out on Netflix Friday. In an interview Thursday, DuVernay said she was “in full support” of the strike. “I think it’s incredible and tragic that it’s not being carried on the front page of newspapers,” she said. “No one even knows this is happening. ” Even as prisoners across the country face retaliation for their actions in the form of solitary confinement, the loss of their job assignments, increased security, and forced relocation, organizers both within and outside prisons are planning for a second wave of strikes this month. The next set of labor actions will begin October 13th, according to organizers. Kinketik Justice, a prisoner in solitary confinement in Holman, who helped plan the national September 9th strike, said he hopes that lawyers and individuals will go directly to jails such as his to document conditions and advocate for prisoners. “You all want to tell a story,” he told BuzzFeed News. “The Alabama prison system is slavery with a thousand dollar suit on. ”",

    "text": "Two California officers were shot and killed Saturday after being called to a Palm Springs home for a domestic disturbance call, police said. Three Palm Springs Police Department officers were trying to convince a man to surrender when the suspect shot and wounded the three officers, Police Chief Bryan Reyes said during an emotional press conference Saturday. The shooter has been arrested and charged with two counts of “murder of a peace officer,” police said in a statement. “I’m awake in a nightmare right now,” he said. Two of the officers died from their wounds. The third officer was taken to a hospital, was alert and talking with investigators. The suspect, who has been named as    Palm Springs resident John Felix, was arrested at about 1. 30 a. m. Sunday. He received   threatening injuries and was treated at a local hospital. The officers were called just after noon to a home by a woman who said her adult son was causing a disturbance, Reyes said. The man had repeatedly threatened to shoot the officers through the door, but the officers continued to try to persuade the man to surrender. Ten minutes after they arrived, Reyes said, shots were fired at the home and the suspect then barricaded himself in his house. After a lengthy standoff, the Riverside County SWAT team “deployed chemical agents” inside the barricaded home, causing Flex to exit the back of the home, Riverside County Sheriff Stan Sniff said at a press conference on Sunday. Felix, Sniff said, did not surrender after exiting, and the SWAT team “utilized less lethal munitions” on Felix, who was wearing soft body armor and had “high capacity magazine” but no weapons on him. Felix’s father, just minutes before the shooting, told a neighbor that his son was “acting crazy” and intended to harm police officer, the Associated Press reported. Video captured by local news station KMIR showed paramedics rushing an injured person to an ambulance at the scene. Officials said it was not clear if the suspect had been shot. The shooting occurred near Sunrise Way and Racquet Ball, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles. The officers were identified as Jose Gil Vega, a    of the department and Lesley Zerebny, a rookie officer who had recently returned to work from maternity leave. “It was a simple family disturbance, and he elected to open fire on the guardians of this city,” Reyes said. Vega was set to retire by the end of this year, Reyes said, and although he was not scheduled to work Saturday, he had picked up an overtime shift. Zerebny, who was 27 years old, had been with the department for a year and a half, Reyes said, and had given birth four months earlier. “They gave it all for you,” Reyes said. Saturday’s fatal shooting is the first time a Palm Springs Police officer has died in the line of duty in more than 50 years. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, the last Palm Springs Police officer shot and killed in the line of duty occurred in 1961. In 1962, a Palm Springs Police officer died in a fatal crash.",

People in the area said they could hear loud booms as the cannonballs were detonated, WTOC reported.’ ’Cannonballs are cast iron balls filled with explosive powder and were used by the Union and Confederate during the Civil War. ’] Beck noted it wasn’t the first time, or probably last, that cannonballs would be found in the area, which was heavily involved in the Civil War. Folly Island was occupied by about 11, 000 Union soldiers from 1863 to 1865. More than 125 years later, Hurricane Hugo caused erosion that uncovered numerous artifacts from their presence. Thousands of people were evacuated from their homes during Hurricane Matthew and at least 22 deaths were blamed on the storm in the US.",

    "text": "Syrian refugees reportedly helped police apprehend a man wanted for possession of explosives and possibly plotting an attack after he led German police on a    manhunt. German police in Saxony state raided the apartment of    Jaber   on Saturday, discovering a detonator and several hundred grams of explosives, which were later destroyed in a controlled detonation. The suspect fled when police fired a warning shot, managing to evade them despite an increased police presence at area train stations. Bakr fled north from Chemnitz to the city of Leipzig, where on Saturday night he sought the aid of fellow refugees in the city’s station for housing, posting to a forum for refugees in the area, German newspaper Bild reported. One of the refugees who responded, named only as Mohammed A. told Bild that Bakr claimed that he was new in the country and had a job prospect lined up. By the next day, the refugees hosting Bakr  —   media reports differ as to whether there were two or three  —   had become suspicious, posting a picture of a sleeping Bakr on Facebook to see if others saw the resemblance between the man in their apartment and the manhunt’s subject. When they realized it was him, Mohammed told Bild, they wrapped him up in several extension cords and went to the police. Their captive also reportedly tried to bribe them to release him but they proceeded to hand him over to the Leipzig authorities. “According to what we know, the preparations in Chemnitz are similar to the preparations for the attacks in Paris and Brussels,” German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said in a statement. According to German media, the man entered Germany in April 2015 and was granted asylum that November. “The methods and behavior of the suspect suggest an [ISIS] context,” said Saxony State Police Chief Joerg Michaelis without providing further details. The reaction to the case has been split among German leaders. On the one hand, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office took special care to highlight the circumstances of Bakr’s arrest. “Our thanks and recognition also go to the man from Syria who told the police where the suspect was and contributed decisively to the arrest,” Ulrike Demmer, a spokeswoman for Merkel, said after thanking law enforcement officials on Monday. But members of Merkel’s own Christian Democratic Union (CDU) including Interior Minister de Maiziere, pointed to the case as evidence that there needs to be more surveillance of refugees and migrants entering Germany.",

That comes out to a total cash price of about $1, 299. If that doesn’t sound like such a great deal, it’s because that’s more than triple the $350 it would cost you at Best Buy.’ ’But    transactions can’t really be compared to retail purchases.    deals don’t require having good credit, and typically come with either a weekly or monthly payment option. Most companies will offer product service during the rental time as well. ’]    is one of many    companies that target mainly   consumers, offering them to opportunity to rent instead of own their furniture and electronics, or to slowly pay off large purchases. Another of the company’s deals: A 40” Vizio LED TV, available for 78 weekly payments of $17. 99  —   a total cost of $2, 078. Walmart was selling the same TV on sale for $298, almost seven times less. “The primary problem is they charge too much,” Margot Saunders, a counsel to the National Consumer Law Center, told BuzzFeed News. “Rather than them charging $250 for a $200 item, they’ll charge $400 for an item. Every incentive for that transaction is for the consumer to fail, for them to not to succeed in buying it. ”    which first started in the US during the 1950s, has grown into an $8. 5 billion industry with roughly 9, 200 stores across the country. At any given time, about 4. 2 million US households are using the industry’s services, according the Association of Progressive Rental Organizations, an industry group. Most    customers are white  —   84%  —   and make less than $36, 000 a year, according to the association. Many don’t want or can’t commit to a   payment plan, or they don’t have access to credit for household purchases, it says. “From a profitability standpoint, the    transaction is still a profitable transaction,” Brad Thomas, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, told BuzzFeed News. “It’s a costly one for the consumers that participate in it but it’s a flexible transaction. They’re not going to end up in bankruptcy if they don’t make a payment. ” “   primarily serves   consumers that the retail and credit markets are unwilling to serve,” Sonia Holland, a spokesperson for    told BuzzFeed News. Bundled within the transaction is a product service agreement and the customer’s ability to stop payments at any time, return the item in question, and then resume the rental when they can begin making payments again, she said. The company’s overhead, labor, truck and fuel costs “necessary to provide this flexibility and assurance for our customers results in a higher cost of doing business,” she added. The    industry is exempt from most federal and state interest rate ceilings, disclosure laws, and other consumer protections in 47 states, because its deals are considered rental agreements, not financial products, said Thomas, the KeyBanc analyst. “If you were to try to look at this as a credit transaction, the implied interest rate could be 100% or more,” he said. “This is not a credit transaction, it’s a rental agreement. You’re not on the hook for anything beyond a week or month and you have the right to return it. ” While the total cost of buying an item through monthly rental payments is far higher than retail prices, only about 6% of   ’s customers choose to pay the highest cost to own, the company told BuzzFeed News. Critics like Saunders, of the National Consumer Law Center, say such transactions merely set people up to fail, particularly those who have bad or no credit and minimal income. “If the consumer doesn’t succeed [with the purchase] the item is returned then able to be rented again,” she said. “It’s a very different dynamic than retail installment sales, because the consumer pays so much more and will end up failing the transaction so much more. ”",

    "text": "Facebook has launched Workplace, a paid chat system for employees to communicate with each other. The service strongly resembles regular Facebook. You do not have to have an existing Facebook account to use Workplace, as it requires a separate login. Users create profiles with photos and other information just as they would on their personal profiles. The platform, which can be downloaded separately from the App Store or installed on a desktop, includes group chat, a news feed, live video, and direct messaging. It also supports voice and video calling. Employees can chat with one another by joining groups or DMing but will not see their    friends in their Workplace news feeds, which only aggregate posts from professional conversations on Workplace. Employees can also follow certain groups or their coworkers to receive updates from them. Facebook has priced Workplace at $3 per month per active user for companies with up to 1, 000 active users, $2 per active user for up to 10, 000 employees, and $1 for more than that. It’s free for nonprofits and educational institutions. According to Workplace’s website, there are no   contracts associated with using the service, nor will the service display ads. Why did Facebook launch an app for work? The company said in a press release that it saw an opening with the new ways people work: “The workplace is about more than just communicating between desks within the walls of an office. Some people spend their entire workday on the go, on their mobile phone. Others spend all day out in the field, or on the road. ” The company repeatedly addressed the press release to “anyone” or “any company” and highlighted the platform’s   reach. By contrast, Slack, Workplace’s most visible competitor, offers some services for free, a “Standard” version for $6. 70 per user, and a “Plus” version for $12. 50 a user. Slack also bills itself as a service for “your   to   company or team. ” And a service called Slack for Enterprise, presumably for larger companies, is in the works, according to the company’s website. Even beyond Slack, office chat technology is a crowded market Workplace is also competing against Microsoft’s Yammer, Salesforce’s Chatter, and Hipchat. Reactions on social media were mixed: ”Facebook at Work” = Dead on Arrival. Corporations have hated Facebook for years for stealing employee productivity. is this facebook at work thing just facebook’s version of slack? Facebook’s new ’Workplace’ looks spiffy, but I wonder if a news feed offers any value to productivity. Workplace by Facebook looks great. A source at Facebook said that the company will not use data collected from Workplace to target users with advertising, and that companies can control their own data via Facebook’s data API. According to Workplace’s website, Facebook is in the process of certifying the product under the   Privacy Shield Framework to help companies in the EU comply with EU data transfer requirements. Recode reports that the social network has been beta testing Workplace for the past two years with roughly a thousand companies. Facebook originally said the service would be live at the end of 2015, also according to Recode.",

    "text": "Kesha is trying to stop Dr. Luke from releasing information from a decade’s worth of her personal medical records, according to court papers filed Monday. The singer had handed over 913 pages of gynecological, psychiatric, and rehabilitation medical records that go back 10 years but Dr. Luke’s legal team is refusing to agree to keep them confidential. Now, she is asking a New York judge to issue a protective order to seal the sensitive records from ever being released to the public. The “Tik ToK” singer has been locked in an epic court battle with music producer Dr. Luke for the past two years that shows no sign of coming to any kind of amicable resolution. In August, Kesha dropped her California sexual assault case against Dr. Luke to focus on his lawsuit against her in New York and to also concentrate on releasing new music. Kesha, who hasn’t released a new album in nearly four years, gave 28 new songs to Dr. Luke’s record label at that time in an effort to restart her career. But even with the California action dismissed, Kesha is still battling it out with Dr. Luke (born Lukasz Gottwald) over his breach of contract case against her in New York. According to the most recent filing, Kesha had asked Dr. Luke to agree to a standard protective order to safeguard her “private and sensitive information from public and media scrutiny. ” But “Gottwald rejected it,” claiming the right to use her medical records, including with the public and media, “without condition,” the court documents state. After negotiations regarding the treatment of the records fell through, Kesha’s attorneys turned to Judge Shirley Kornreich to intervene and grant a request for a protective order. Dr. Luke’s attorneys have not yet responded to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment. His legal team maintains that Kesha waived any privacy rights she might have had over her private medical information by “publicly disclosing details of her alleged medical diagnoses and treatments and putting them at issue in this case, all in an effort to bolster her baseless claims against our clients,” according to court documents. Dr. Luke’s attorney Christine Lepara released this statement that they say clarifies their position: “Because Kesha made public accusations and in the case that she was allegedly harmed by Dr. Luke, the Court ordered her to producer her medical records. Now, Kesha wants to hide her records, while continuing to make   selective and misleading statements to hurt my clients publicly. Our position is that the Court —  and not Kesha’s lawyers —   should decide whether Kesha’s medical information remains confidential given her public disclosures. ” Kesha’s attorneys, though, argue Dr. Luke just wants to use the records for “no reason other than to embarrass” her. This, they say, is just another example of Dr. Luke’s “scorched earth litigation tactics” that also include having her hire 25 contract attorneys to review irrelevant documents. “Gottwald, who is purported to be worth an excess of $100 million, has made clear his intent to make the litigation as expensive as possible for the single defendant Ms. Sebert who is currently unable to publish music without Gottwald’s involvement,” the court papers filed by Kesha, whose last name is Sebert, state. “Gottwald’s strategy in the litigation has been to subject Ms. Sebert to extreme embarrassment and harassment going as far as to raise questions in depositions regarding whether Ms. Sebert is ‘sexually aggressive. ’” A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 26 on this motion for a protective order.",

He put on a vest so that he would be protected so he could kill police officers. ” Felix was charged with   murder in the shooting deaths of Palm Springs police officers Jose “Gil” Vega and Lesley Zerebny  —   who had recently returned from maternity leave  —   on Saturday as they responded to a domestic disturbance call. When the officers arrived, prosectors say, Felix was armed, fortified, and ready. “I would describe this as an ambush,” Hestrin said. “I think these police officers walked into a trap. ” The officers had been trying to convince Felix to surrender, speaking to him through a screen door of the home when Felix opened fire, striking Vega, Zerebny, and a third officer who survived, police said. Felix fled after the shooting, prompting a lockdown of the neighborhood and a manhunt through the desert town. Hestrin said Felix was wearing body armor and used   bullets in the attack. “This individual knew what he was doing, he was deliberate in his actions,” Hestrin said. Felix also faces charges of lying in wait, attempted murder, and being in possession of stolen property, including an   rifle he used to shoot the officers, Hestrin said. The charges make Felix, who was prohibited from owning a weapon because of a previous conviction of assault with a firearm in a gang shooting, eligible for the death penalty. Hestrin said he has not made a decision on whether to seek the death penalty, but that he planed to make that call in the next three weeks.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON  —   Russia’s ambassador to the US said Tuesday that faulty intelligence could be behind Washington’s decision to accuse the Kremlin of hacking and trying to influence the US election. Sergey Kislyak made the claim during an event at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, his first public appearance since the White House formally accused Russia on Friday. “We have seen a number of statements by our colleagues in American intelligence on a number of issues that weren’t exactly true in history. I can give you a number of examples,” Kislyak said when asked to respond to the administration’s accusation. He went on to cite the flawed intelligence on weapons of mass destruction that led to the Iraq war, and a more recent US strike on a Syrian Army position in Syria, which the US has said was a mistake. “These things happen,” he said. Kislyak flatly denied that Moscow was attempting to meddle in the election. “We are watching very carefully the election campaign in this country,” Kislyak said. “We do not interfere into internal affairs in the United States, not by my statements, not by electronic or other means.“ As Kislyak sees it, the rapid deterioration of US —  Russia relations  —   seen most recently in the curt end to talks over a ceasefire in Syria  —   is by no fault of the Kremlin. “It’s not us who are started it. It’s not us who are fueling it,” he said. “But the result is where we are. ” Kislyak’s remarks come just days since the administration, after months of silence, formally accused the Kremlin of attempting to sow distrust in the US election system. Not only were Russian efforts underway, the White House said, but they were being conducted at the behest of the Russian government. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied those claims.",

Terence Crutcher, 40, was shot by Officer Betty Shelby after his car stalled on the road, the incident captured on a patrol car’s dash camera. Manslaughter charges have been filed against Shelby, who was released from jail after posting bond. The autopsy report, conducted by the Oklahoma Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, showed Crutcher tested positive for Phencyclidine, also known as PCP, which can cause hallucinations and other effects. According to an investigative affidavit of the shooting, Shelby saw Crutcher and his car while responding to a different call. Crutcher was not answering her questions and walked toward his car, with his hands in the air, while she told him to stop. A second officer also responded to the incident, the report stated, and told Shelby he was ready to use his Taser if needed. Crutcher at one point reached into his car, the officer used his Taser, and Shelby fired her gun. According to the autopsy, Crutcher died from a gunshot wound to the chest, breaking through three of his ribs. A bullet was recovered on the left side of his chest.

    "text": "The United States launched a series of missiles into Yemen early Thursday in response to two attacks on a US Navy ship in the past four days. The USS Nitze, a destroyer based in the Red Sea, launched multiple Tomahawk missiles into territory controlled by Yemeni rebels to destroy a set of radar sites, the Pentagon said in a statement. Early assessments indicated that all three radar sites targeted were destroyed. “These limited   strikes were conducted to protect our personnel, our ships, and our freedom of navigation in this important maritime passageway,” Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said. “The United States will respond to any further threat to our ships and commercial traffic, as appropriate, and will continue to maintain our freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, the Bab   and elsewhere around the world. ” The strikes were ordered by President Barack Obama and came “at the recommendation of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Joseph Dunford,” Cook said. All three radar sides were said to be involved in an incident with the USS Mason, a destroyer deployed to the Yemeni coast earlier this month that was forced to take defensive maneuvers in order to avoid a missile. The attack launched from near the coastal city of Al Hudiyah, the Pentagon said in a statement released on Wednesday. Per the statement, there was no damage to the ship or the crew. “Those who threaten our forces should know that US commanders retain the right to defend their ships, and we will respond to this threat at the appropriate time and in the appropriate manner,” the earlier statement concluded. The Mason first came under attack on Sunday, when two cruise missiles were fired from Yemen at it and the nearby USS Ponce. According to the US Naval Institute, the Mason launched three missiles to attempt to intercept those fired from Yemen. It is still unclear whether the interception was successful or if the missiles would have fallen into the sea on their own. Both attacks, the Defense Department has said, came from territory in Yemen controlled by rebels known as the Houthis. The Houthis, who are backed by Iran, seized control of Yemen’s capital last year and have since then been under constant bombardment by forces in a   coalition. The US has supported Saudi Arabia in its campaign, including refueling Saudi planes, and recently completed a $1. 15 billion arms sale to the Gulf state.",

Fo was best known for the play Accidental Death of an Anarchist, and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1997. The ANSA news agency reported he died after being hospitalized two weeks ago with severe back pain. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi  —   who in recent years regularly fell victim to the dramatist’s sharp political satire  —   said: “With Dario Fo, Italy loses one of the great protagonists of theater, culture, and the civic life of our country. His satire, his research, his work on set design, his multifaceted artistic activity remain the legacy of a great Italian in the world. ” Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat also expressed his sadness at Fo’s death. Something of a dramatic polymath, Fo was well known for his   political activism, and appeared at a rally in Rome in support of the   Five Star Movement just last month, according to Reuters. The movement’s leader, Beppe Grillo, had previously suggested he should stand as the country’s next president  —   an idea Fo declined, citing his old age. In a statement posted on Grillo’s website, the Five Star Movement said it mourned the loss of Fo: “The movement remembers the speech he gave at a rally in Duomo Square [in Milan] in 2013, when he told us, ‘Fatelo voi!’ [you do it please bring change! ]. You will always be with us, Dario. ” Accidental Death of an Anarchist  —   considered a classic of   theater  —   was based on the true story of anarchist railwayman who died after falling from the fourth floor of the Milan police station where he was being interrogated. While the police said he committed suicide, Fo’s retelling suggested he had been killed. In keeping with his   ways, for much of his career Fo was at odds with the Catholic church, who denounced his work as “blasphemous. ” His 1969 piece Mistero Buffo [Comical Mystery] was a controversial, improvised solo satire based on Bible stories, which led to a number of churches warning their congregation not to see it. His muse, collaborator, and wife of nearly 60 years Franca Rame died in 2013.",

    "text": "The San Francisco Police Department has practiced implicit and institutionalized racial bias, according to a federal investigation that found blacks and Latinos in the Bay Area were more likely to be pulled over and searched by officers. The findings were made in a Department of Justice (DOJ) report released Wednesday, which also found that the police department has outdated    policies and has inadequately investigated   shootings. The federal review comes after a series of scandals rocked the Northern California police force, including the resignation of its police chief in May after officers shot and killed a    woman. In April, the county’s public defender announced racist text messages exchanged by more than a dozen police officers could also affect more than 200 pending cases in court, prompting an internal investigation and suspensions against the officers involved. The federal review, done by the DOJ’s Community Oriented Police Services, found that the police department’s officers were more likely to stop black and Latino drivers. They were also more likely to be searched by police, even though they were less likely to be found with contraband, the report stated. The report also found that there were no racial disparities when officers used force. The department also appeared to be lacking in several administrative duties, such not addressing incidents of bias misconduct, not adequately investigating    incidents, and not maintaining complete   shooting files. It also criticized the department for a lack of transparency when officers were disciplined for misconduct. In a statement, the police department said it was committed to implementing improvements to improve data collection to improve its work. It would also look at training practices to address issues of racial bias and    practices. “The SFPD is   its academy curriculum to include   training, use of force training with a focus on sanctity of life,” the department said in a statement. The department also noted that despite the faults found in the report, its “overall diversity is higher than the national average. ” The report offered 272 recommendations for improvements. “We remain firmly committed to implementing the recommendations of the DOJ to increase transparency and public trust and to meet national best practice standards for community policing,” the department said in a statement. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee also said that the city and police force were ready to implement all of the recommendations in the report. “In the past 10 months, we have worked hard to put reforms in place,” Lee said. “We have made progress, but there is still a lot of work to do. ”",

    "text": "The U. S. Department of Education declared Wednesday that Wesley College in Delaware violated the rights of students accused of sexual assault by rushing to judgment in sexual misconduct cases and failing to follow the school’s own policies after receiving reports of harassment. Wesley, a small college in Dover, discriminated against students accused of sexual misconduct in multiple cases between 2013 and 2015, according to an investigation by the education department’s Office for Civil Rights. The federal government said Wesley’s treatment of accused students violated their rights under Title IX, the gender equity law more often used by victims to assert that their rights were violated. Title IX has played a key role in the Obama administration’s efforts to combat campus rape and mistreatment of victims  —   though the effort has attracted criticism from some Republicans in Congress, conservative columnists, and the civil liberties group the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) who have argued that accused students get short shrift during campus proceedings. Dozens of men have sued their universities claiming their rights were violated too. Wesley is not the first school found to have violated Title IX in its treatment of accused students, according to an education department spokeswoman. The Office for Civil Rights cited the University of Virginia in a report last year. But this marks the first time a press release has been issued that focuses solely on how a school dealt with students accused of sexual misconduct. Generally, such announcements focus on treatment of alleged victims. Justin Dillon, an attorney who frequently represents students accused of sexual assault, told BuzzFeed News he does not see this as representing a change in thinking at the education department. “The college’s violations of its own policies  —   such as its failure to even show the complainant the evidence against him  —   were so flagrant that even OCR had little choice but to come down on it,” Dillon said. “So while this is nice to see, I don’t think one can fairly say it’s the pendulum swinging back towards fairness. ” Among the violations cited by federal investigators were that Wesley imposed interim suspensions against students accused of sexual assault without interviewing them, and that at least one accused student was never interviewed during the investigation into his alleged wrongdoing. Nor were accused students given the chance to present witnesses and other evidence at their disciplinary hearings, investigators concluded. While the Office for Civil Rights has previously knocked schools for taking too long in investigations, it found that Wesley completed them too quickly  —   in as little as two business days. This “may not provide sufficient time” to conduct a thorough investigation, the office said. The federal inquiry resulted from a complaint filed in May 2015 on behalf of an accused student who was charged and expelled within a week, just before he was to have graduated. The student said the report against him was not fully investigated, resulting in him being wrongly disciplined. In that case, two female students reported that a consensual sexual encounter he had with a woman was livestreamed to a group of fraternity members. The filming happened without the woman’s consent, but she said the accused student was not involved in organizing it. The man and three friends were placed on interim suspension after one of them admitted to having a camera set up for the livestream. Neither the accused student nor his friends was given an opportunity to schedule an “educational conference” to give their version of events and contest or accept their guilt, which was standard at the time for the college’s sexual misconduct cases. None of them was given a copy of the report containing the accusations or the investigative findings prior to their judicial hearing. The hearing took place on April 7, 2015, a week after they were accused. All four were found guilty and expelled. According to the investigation’s findings, the woman subsequently learned that the accused student did not know about the filming until after it had happened and told one of the administrators, but his expulsion was upheld. “Here, some of the failures are pretty egregious,” Will Creeley, vice president of legal and public advocacy at FIRE, told BuzzFeed News. “You have the student who was accused unable to tell his side of the story, which is basic due process 101. ” In a statement, the school said, “Wesley College appreciates the insights and recommendations provided by the Office of Civil Rights, and will incorporate them into our ongoing efforts of providing our students and community an educational environment that is second to none. ” According to the college’s website, it has an enrollment of about 2, 500 students. Wesley will now have to make a series of reforms to its sexual harassment policies, improve training for staff, establish a Title IX committee that includes staff and students, and reinvestigate specific cases that the Office for Civil Rights highlighted from 2013 to 2015 and “provide remedies as warranted. ” This could include paying the accused students for the cost of enrollment at other schools.",

    "text": "A group that has stoked fears about transgender women preying on girls has submitted enough signatures to place Massachusetts’s new   law on the November 2018 ballot in an attempt to repeal it. Keep MA Safe submitted 34, 231 valid voter signatures to send the referendum to voters, Brian McNiff, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Secretary of State’s office, told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday. The group gathered roughly 2, 000 signatures more than required. The law, which took effect this month after being passed by lawmakers this spring, bans discrimination on the basis of gender identity in places of public accommodation. Among other things, it guarantees that transgender people may use publicly accessible restrooms, locker rooms, and showers that match their gender identity. Keep MA Safe worries those rules pose a threat to women and girls by allowing transgender women (which the group refers to as men) into female restroom and locker rooms. The campaign’s website said the law would expose girls to “sexual predators who claim ‘confusion’ about their gender as a cover for their evil intentions. ” “We think it is a dangerous law and we would like to repeal it,” Keep MA Safe spokesperson Andrew Beckwith said in a phone interview. “The definition of gender identity in the law is extremely broad and ripe for abuse. ” “It doesn’t matter how a    man identifies. If he has a male body, I have problem with him being in a locker room with my daughter,” Beckwith added. Since 2002, Boston has had an ordinance on the books providing the same transgender protections. While Beckwith could not cite an example of that ordinance enabling harm to women or girls, he cited a news story about an “anatomical man who identified as female” that made women uncomfortable in a women’s homeless shelter. LGBT advocates have faced a couple of spectacular setbacks as they pushed for nondiscrimination policies in the year since the Supreme Court legalized   marriage. Voters in Houston, Texas, repealed a nondiscrimination ordinance last fall after a campaign warned it allowed “men in women’s bathrooms. ” And this year, after Charlotte, North Carolina, passed a nondiscrimination ordinance, the legislature passed a bill to neutralize it based on the same rationale. Churches and clergy sued Massachusetts officials on Tuesday to avoid compliance with the law. However, Kasey Suffredini, chief program officer of the LGBT group Freedom for All Americans, believes the Massachusetts law will be upheld. “When presented with the question of whether to continue to treat transgender people as equal members of the Commonwealth in 2018, they will vote yes,” he said in a statement. For his part, Beckwith of Keep MA Safe said he does not have polling data showing where voters stand on the law, adding that he does need to cite an example of actual harm the nondiscrimination law may cause over the next two years. “If my daughter is being viewed or ogled by a man, that is violation of her privacy,” he said. “That is a problem. ”",

Stumpf was savaged by Elizabeth Warren in a congressional hearing last month, with the Senator criticizing his “gutless” and calling for him to take responsibility for the thousands of Wells Fargo sales representatives that had illegally opened customer accounts without their authorization. “You should resign,” Warren told Stumpf in the hearing, which went viral on social media. “You should give back the money that you took while this scam was going on, and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. ” In a statement, Wells Fargo said Stumpf was retiring, and that he believed “new leadership at this time is appropriate to guide Wells Fargo through its current challenges. ” Stumpf’s position grew more tenuous on Sunday when Vice News revealed one of the bank’s top executives was warned of improperly created accounts in 2005  —   five years prior to when he said the board was first made aware of the problems.",

    "text": "’It isn’t just one thing that has everyone feeling   lately, as this chart tracking the results over the last five years shows:’] It’s OK, United States  —   it isn’t just you feeling a bit off. More than 60% of people in a newly released global survey believe that their country is on the wrong track. The survey, conducted in September by polling firm Ipsos, asked people in 25 countries whether they believe their country is on the right or wrong track. And on the whole, people are not pleased: An average of 63% said that their country is heading in the wrong direction. Most pessimistic is France, where a full 88% of those polled believe the country is on the wrong track. That will likely be a factor in the upcoming presidential election there, which will take place after several terror attacks and ongoing protests against changes in labor laws. Joining them at the bottom of the rankings are Mexico and Brazil  —   where 85% and 84% of respondents are dissatisfied, respectively  —   both of which are currently embroiled in political turmoil. Italy, Spain, and South Africa round out the bottom six, each of which has had various economic woes over the last few years. Countries where economic growth has been high are much more comfortable. In China, Saudi Arabia, and India, more than 60% of those reached are sure the country is on the right track. An important caveat: Ipsos’s polls are conducted online and they make clear that the results in countries where internet penetration is low don’t represent a national mood. So that may be part of the reason why China  —   where 90% of those who responded think the country is on the up and up  —   seems so content. The United States falls around the average in the survey, with 64% of respondents saying that the country is on the wrong track. The poll doesn’t follow up to allow people to answer just why that is the case, though, so you won’t be able to figure out what to correct if you’re reading just the polling numbers. If it makes you feel better, take comfort in the fact that at least people consistently think the world is terrible. Ipsos also asked people to name their top three concerns out of 17 issues provided. Globally, unemployment was the issue most often listed as causing worry  —   38% of respondents put it in their top three. (That’s up by 2% from a version of the survey conducted in August, but still down 20 points from 2010.) The results vary more country by country. In Turkey, terrorism is far and away the biggest issue: 76% of those polled put it in their top three most pressing issues. A similar proportion in Peru are worried about crime and violence and in Spain about unemployment. The United States, though, is a grab bag of anxieties, with the   concern  —   terrorism  —   a major issue for only 35% of respondents. And because you’re surely curious, ranking dead last among respondents in terms of concerns both in the US and around the world: access to credit. (Sorry, Alexander Hamilton.)",

    "text": "A man in custody for possession of explosives and possibly plotting an attack killed himself a day after Syrian refugees aided in his capture, according to German officials. The Associated Press on Wednesday quoted Justice Ministry spokesman Joerg Herold as saying that    Jaber   killed himself while in custody at some point Wednesday evening, and “the incident was still being investigated. ” German police in Saxony state raided the apartment of Bakr on Saturday, discovering a detonator and several hundred grams of explosives, which were later destroyed in a controlled detonation. The suspect fled when police fired a warning shot, managing to evade them despite an increased police presence at area train stations. Bakr fled north from Chemnitz to the city of Leipzig, where on Saturday night he sought the aid of fellow refugees in the city’s station for housing, posting to a forum for refugees in the area, German newspaper Bild reported. One of the refugees who responded, named only as Mohammed A. told Bild that Bakr claimed that he was new in the country and had a job prospect lined up. By the next day, the refugees hosting Bakr  —   media reports differ as to whether there were two or three  —   had become suspicious, posting a picture of a sleeping Bakr on Facebook to see if others saw the resemblance between the man in their apartment and the manhunt’s subject. When they realized it was him, Mohammed told Bild, they wrapped him up in several extension cords and went to the police. Their captive also reportedly tried to bribe them to release him but they proceeded to hand him over to the Leipzig authorities. “According to what we know, the preparations in Chemnitz are similar to the preparations for the attacks in Paris and Brussels,” German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said in a statement. According to German media, the man entered Germany in April 2015 and was granted asylum that November. “The methods and behavior of the suspect suggest an [ISIS] context,” said Saxony State Police Chief Joerg Michaelis without providing further details. The reaction to the case has been split among German leaders. On the one hand, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office took special care to highlight the circumstances of Bakr’s arrest. “Our thanks and recognition also go to the man from Syria who told the police where the suspect was and contributed decisively to the arrest,” Ulrike Demmer, a spokeswoman for Merkel, said after thanking law enforcement officials on Monday. But members of Merkel’s own Christian Democratic Union (CDU) including Interior Minister de Maiziere, pointed to the case as evidence that there needs to be more surveillance of refugees and migrants entering Germany.",

He put on a vest so that he would be protected so he could kill police officers. ” Felix was charged with   murder in the shooting deaths of Palm Springs police officers Jose “Gil” Vega and Lesley Zerebny  —   who had recently returned from maternity leave  —   on Saturday as they responded to a domestic disturbance call. When the officers arrived, prosectors say, Felix was armed, fortified, and ready. “I would describe this as an ambush,” Hestrin said. “I think these police officers walked into a trap. ” The officers had been trying to convince Felix to surrender, speaking to him through a screen door of the home when Felix opened fire, striking Vega, Zerebny, and a third officer who survived, police said. Felix fled after the shooting, prompting a lockdown of the neighborhood and a manhunt through the desert town. Hestrin said Felix was wearing body armor and used   bullets in the attack. “This individual knew what he was doing, he was deliberate in his actions,” Hestrin said. Felix also faces charges of lying in wait, attempted murder, and being in possession of stolen property, including an   rifle he used to shoot the officers, Hestrin said. The charges make Felix, who was prohibited from owning a weapon because of a previous conviction of assault with a firearm in a gang shooting, eligible for the death penalty. Hestrin said he has not made a decision on whether to seek the death penalty, but that he planed to make that call in the next three weeks.",

    "text": "Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s visit to Nigeria, his first to   Africa, has put the country’s tech businesses firmly in the world’s spotlight.  Zuckerberg staged a surprise visit to the country’s economic capital Lagos on Tuesday and his first stop was a local innovation center and tech hub in Yaba, an area on the mainland of Lagos known as Nigeria’s Silicon Valley.  There was no fanfare amid tight security and some of those working at the   Hub, called CcHUB, didn’t even know Zuckberg was coming. He appeared nervous, a little startled even, as he launched into an impromptu speech about why he was there.  Watch video of Zuckerberg’s visit, He said: ”This is my first trip to   Africa. I’ll be meeting with developers and entrepreneurs, and learning about the startup ecosystem in Nigeria. The energy here is amazing and I’m excited to learn as much as I can.” At the CcHUB, he talked to children at a summer coding camp and entrepreneurs who visit the center to build and launch their apps.  Zuckerberg thrilled Nigerians by walking around the streets of Lagos without any signs of armed guards or heavy security. He was also spotted jogging on the Lekki Bridge Wednesday morning.  Figures released Wednesday show Nigeria has officially dipped into recession as its second quarter GDP fell by more than 2% compared to last year.  However, running a business in the country has always been tough for young entrepreneurs such as Bosun Tijani and Femi Longe, who   the  hub Zuckerberg visited in 2011.  Successful startups in Nigeria thrive against the odds of weak infrastructure, anemic power supply and general lack of funding and investment.  Tijani told CNN that Zuckerberg’s visit would give Nigeria’s fledgling startup scene the shot in the arm it desperately needs. ”By coming here first, he’s given a lot of hope to young people here,” Tijani said. He added that entrepreneurs like Zuckerberg were inspiring because his approach to Facebook has never been about making a lot of money.  ”It’s been about creating something that’s going to change the world and obviously if you do that, you are bound to reap the benefit,” Tijani said.  Idris Ayodeji Bello, an ’afropreneur’ and angel investor from Nigeria, said, ”Mark’s visit was a much needed external validation of the sweat and immense efforts, mostly unsung, of the young Nigerians who have kept at it. And it was heartwarming to see all the attention his visit got, even from some young people who are rarely excited by much beyond music and entertainment.” Like a lot of entrepreneurs on the continent, the founders of CcHUB have been quietly plugging away before catching the attention of one of the world’s biggest tech founders.  Zuckerberg singled out their business because of their proven track record in building and incubating startups that tackle the country’s myriad social issues such as Lifebank, an app that locates available blood supplies and delivers it to hospitals.  Another entrepreneur who met Zuckerberg was Adebayo Adegbembo, who runs Genii games, a platform to make it easier for kids to learn about African culture both in Nigeria and the diaspora. He said Zuckerberg learned a few words of Yoruba and spoke of his love of languages.  ”To have Mark show that kind of interest in us is a huge stamp of approval,” Adegbembo said.  Tijani and his business partner had a vision of creating a tech business district and persuaded the government and a local cable provider to install fiber optic cables on their street providing affordable and fast   access to anyone within the hub’s vicinity.  When they started there were five tech businesses, now there are 60 and the area attracts an increasing number of entrepreneurs.  During a Q A streamed live on Facebook on Wednesday, Zuckerberg talked about plans to make the company’s tools and apps more affordable for SMEs in the country.  He added that he was proud of recently putting the Hausa language, largely spoken in northern Nigeria, on the platform and revealed plans to expand to other Nigerian languages. Nigeria is the largest market in Africa for Facebook 16 million Nigerians using the platform monthly, with 7 million logging onto the site daily:  97% of them on mobile, according to figures from the network. Zuckerberg has also made no secret of his interest in Nigerian startups and other African tech industries. In June, he invested millions of dollars in a   startup called Andela via the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and in May he launched Free Basics, a partnership with a local telecoms provider, which allows people to browse websites for free, a very appealing prospect in a country where data prices can be prohibitively high.  Although, it is not without controversy as critics have said it violates the central tenets of net neutrality, which stipulate that all Internet content and users should be treated equally.   free content isn’t considered fair or right, according to the critics. But it appears to be more than just the numbers stacking up for Facebook and Zuckerberg. He has said he is in the country to listen and learn and take ideas back to California on how to support businesses across the continent. He’s also very interested in the creative partnerships and in exploring where tech and creativity intersect. While in Lagos, he met with leading figures in Nigeria’s Nollywood film industry and talked about how the burgeoning industry could be a huge revenue driver for the country. He said: ”One of the things I am most excited about my trip to Lagos is going to check out Nollywood. Nollywood sounds like a national treasure and the ability to produce video content that is moving and emotional transcends boundaries and will help tell stories of the amazing innovation, engineering and culture to the whole world.” Read more from African Startup",

    "text": "(CNN) The pictures are heartbreaking: Millions of honeybees lie dead after being sprayed with an insecticide targeting   mosquitoes.  ”On Saturday, it was total energy, millions of bees foraging, pollinating, making honey for winter,” beekeeper Juanita Stanley said. ”Today, it stinks of death. Maggots and other insects are feeding on the honey and the baby bees who are still in the hives. It’s heartbreaking.” Stanley,   of Flowertown Bee Farm and Supply in Summerville, South Carolina, said she lost 46 beehives    more than 3 million bees    in mere minutes after the spraying began Sunday morning. ”Those that didn’t die immediately were poisoned trying to drag out the dead,” Stanley said. ”Now, I’m going to have to destroy my hives, the honey, all my equipment. It’s all contaminated.” Stanley said Summerville Fire Capt. Andrew Macke, who keeps bees as a hobby, also lost thousands of bees. She said neither of them had protected their hives because they didn’t know about the aerial spraying.  ”Andrew has two hives,” Stanley said. ”He didn’t know they were going to spray. His wife called him. His bees are at their porch right by their home, and she saw dead bees everywhere.” It’s a tragedy that could be repeated across the country as cases of Zika continue to rise and local mosquito control districts struggle to protect their residents and ease local fears. The spray fell from the skies between 6:30 and 8:30 a. m. Sunday. It was the first aerial spraying in 14 years, according to Dorchester County Administrator Jason Ward, part of the county’s efforts to combat Zika after four local residents were diagnosed with the virus.  ”We chose Sunday morning because few people would be out and about that early on a weekend,” Ward said. ”To protect the bees, you don’t want to spray after the sun has been up more two hours, so we scheduled it early.” The county used a product called Trumpet, which contains the pesticide naled, recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for control of adult Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that transmits Zika.  According to the manufacturer’s label (PDF) Trumpet is ”highly toxic to bees exposed to direct treatment on blooming crops or weeds. To minimize hazard to bees, it is recommended that the product is not applied more than two hours after sunrise or two hours before sunset, limiting application to times when bees are least active.” ”We followed that recommendation,” said Ward, ”which is also the policy laid out by the state, using a pesticide the state has approved for use.” Ward says the county also notified residents of the spraying by posting a notice on its website at 9 a. m. Friday, two days before the spraying. He added that it alerted beekeepers who were on the local mosquito control registry by phone or email, a common practice before truck spraying. ”That’s true when they sprayed by trucks they told me in advance, and we talked about it so I could protect my bees,” Stanley said. ”But nobody called me about the aerial spraying nobody told me at all.”  Stanley said she ”would have been screaming and pleading on their doorstep if they had.” ” ’Do it at night when bees are done foraging,’ I would have told them,” she added, breaking into tears. ”But they sprayed at 8 a. m. Sunday, and all of my bees were out, doing their work by then.”  Macke was also not informed, Ward said, because he, like many hobby beekeepers, is not on the local mosquito control registry.  ”We are obviously saddened by the fact people have lost their hives, and we have gone back and looked at our procedures,” Ward said. ”We will now give up to five days of advance notice, and we have expanded our list to include more local beekeepers.” Stanley says she doesn’t think there was malice involved, but that doesn’t make the loss of her ”honey girls” any less painful. ”This wasn’t about the honey,” she said. ”It was about raising bees and selling them to other people, and spreading the honey girls out there into the world. Now, I can’t help anyone anymore, because all of them are dead.”",

    "text": "Washington (CNN) The US and other members of the international community granted Iran exemptions to its requirements under the agreement that sought to curb its nuclear program, according to a new report by the   Institute for Science and International Security. The alleged granting of ”secret” exemptions to Iran by the Joint Commission, the deal’s implementing body, is likely to thrust the controversial accord, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) back into the political spotlight.  The report says ”most of the conditions” laid out in the agreement ”were met by Iran” but it also claims Iran would have not been in compliance by January 16, 2016, the deal’s   Implementation Day, without the exemptions to the requirement that Iran limit its stockpile of low enriched uranium to under  . The exemptions supposedly pertained to uranium in ”waste form,” according to the report, but the authors noted that that waste was potentially recoverable.  The report’s authors, David Albright and Andrea Stricker, went on to blast President Barack Obama’s administration for keeping these exemptions secret.   ”Any rationale for keeping these exemptions secret appears unjustified,” the report said. Albright told CNN that the additional low enriched uranium could reduce the amount of time needed for Iran to develop a nuclear bomb if it decided to break the accord.   The report said another exemption allowed Iran to operate 19 ”hot cells” larger than specified in the accords, larger hot cells could be used to produce plutonium, which can also be used to produce a nuclear weapon.  ”We were also worried that these exemptions or decisions by the Joint Commission set bad precedents that Iran is going to use to try and further weaken the conditions of the Iran deal,” added Albright, a physicist and expert on Iran’s nuclear program. The report’s conclusions were first published by Reuters.  The State Department pushed back Thursday on the report’s findings but noted that the workings of the Joint Commission were always confidential and therefore declined to discuss specifics of the commission’s work. ”The Joint Commission has not and will not loosen any of the commitments and has not provided any exceptions that would allow Iran to retain or process material In excess of its (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) limits that it could use in a breakout scenario,” State Department spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. ”There’s been no cutting of slack,” he added.  The White House also criticized the report Thursday, with spokesman Josh Earnest saying the administration had ”significant objections” to it. ”Iran is in compliance with the agreement. That’s not my opinion. That’s not rhetoric. That is not a conjecture. That is a fact that is verified by independent international experts who, because of the agreement, now have the kind of access that is required to verify it,” Earnest said. Kirby said that the International Atomic Energy Agency had also confirmed that Iran was fulfilling its obligations under the deal, noting that Iran’s ”breakout” period for obtaining a nuclear weapon had been extended from several months to a year as a result of the deal. A senior State Department official offered an even more strident rebuttal, telling CNN, ”The United States and its partners did not and will not allow Iran to skirt its JCPOA commitments.” The official said that Iran met all of its commitments on implementation day and that ”Any assertion to the contrary is completely false.” ”Iran has never been over its 300 kilogram limit for low enriched uranium,” the official added.  The White House also criticized the report Thursday, with spokesman Josh Earnest saying the administration had ”significant objections.” ”Iran is in compliance with the agreement. That’s not my opinion. That’s not rhetoric. That is not a conjecture. That is a fact that is verified by independent international experts who, because of the agreement, now have the kind of access that is required to verify it,” Earnest said. Republicans were quick to use the report’s conclusions to criticize the administration. ”This latest report further confirms that the Obama administration has consistently misled the American people on the Iran nuclear deal,” the Republican Jewish Coalition wrote in a statement.  Albright sounded a pessimistic note on the future of the agreement during his interview with CNN. ”The trend, in my mind, is not good. It’s toward weakening the deal instead of strengthening the deal,” he said. Iran recently announced an expansion of its civilian nuclear capabilities, saying that construction will begin on two more   nuclear reactors at the Bushehr nuclear power plant next week, according to the country’s atomic energy chief quoted on   IRNA Wednesday.",

    "text": "Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) Protesters packed the streets of Venezuela’s capital Thursday, demanding a recall vote to remove President Nicolas Maduro from power. Wearing white and waving flags as they marched, demonstrators blamed Maduro’s government for food shortages and major economic problems. ”There is no food. There is no paper. There is no medicine. We are dying,” Maria Alvarez told CNN en Español. ”Please, help Venezuela. This has to end. Maduro, you have to understand that your time is up.” Opposition leaders dubbed the massive demonstration ”The Takeover of Caracas” and said they hoped the peaceful protest would have a historic turnout. Crowd estimates varied greatly    depending on who was making them.   The opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democratica, claimed more than 1 million people took part. But the   news agency AVN said that only about 30, 000 people attended the   march, Protesters filled three major avenues in the east of Caracas. Images of the protests showed throngs of people in plazas and roadways. Government warns of violence, Tensions were clear as officers in riot gear stood face to face with lines of demonstrators. So far, the situation has remained peaceful.  But supporters of the opposition have warned that the government could be gearing up for a crackdown. Venezuelan officials say the opposition has a nefarious aim: violence in the streets.  State television broadcast video of supporters of the government rallying in a large ” ” protest.  Maduro told crowds clad in red that authorities had detained   opposition leaders who were planning to plant bombs in the capital. He pressed his supporters to be ready in case of a coup. ”If a day comes and you see that something happens to President Nicolas Maduro . .. go into the streets and get justice,” he said. In recent days, the government has detained at least six opposition leaders, accusing them of conspiring against the government. ”Those detained have a history of destabilizing acts in our country, and it cannot be ruled out that there will be more detentions of   elements of the Venezuelan ” Interior and Justice Minister Nestor Reverol said this week. Maduro told supporters that he was signing a decree to strip lawmakers of their immunity so they can face prosecution for crimes. The opposition holds the majority of seats in Venezuela’s National Assembly. ’Maduro is afraid!’ Speaking to demonstrators, opposition leader Henrique Capriles accused government officials of trying to block people from reaching the protests. Government threats won’t make the opposition back down, said Capriles, who narrowly lost to Maduro in a 2013 election after longtime leader Hugo Chavez’s death. ”Maduro is afraid! The more obstacles there are, the more people will peacefully be in the streets!” Capriles wrote on Twitter. Opposition leaders said Thursday’s march was the first of many protests they plan to hold as they push for a referendum. Maria Corina Machado, an opposition leader who’s been a vocal critic of Maduro, said the large turnout sent a clear message. ”Today in the streets we demonstrated that a new phase of the fight has begun. The transition is urgent and inevitable,” she wrote on Twitter. For months, opposition parties have been pushing for the government to hold a referendum on Maduro’s presidency. Many Venezuelans have lost patience with the socialist president amid widespread shortages of food and medical supplies, surging crime levels, rolling blackouts and massive inflation. Experts predict Venezuela’s economy will shrink by 10% this year, while inflation will rise by 700%.  Venezuelan officials say they aren’t to blame for the country’s mounting problems they accuse the political right of carrying out an economic war to undermine the government.

    "text": "(CNN) A fire hazard has prompted Polaris Industries Inc. to recall two models of recreational   vehicles, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday. The engine can overheat, and the turbo system’s drain tube can loosen, possibly causing a fire.  The   company said it received 19 reports of the ROVs catching fire, resulting in six burn injuries. One of the fires, occurring in Utah’s American Fork Canyon, caused severe burns on a young child and destroyed 15 acres of forest land, the commission reported. People should immediately stop using the ROVs and contact Polaris to schedule a free repair. All   2016 Polaris RZR XP Turbo and RZR XP 4 Turbo ROVs need to be returned. Vehicles were purchased at dealers nationwide between August 2015 and July 2016.  The recall includes nearly 13, 000 vehicles, including 2, 230 ROVs recalled in December. ”Polaris” is stamped onto the front grille of the ROVs, sold in blue, gray, orange and red. ”RZR” is printed on the rear box or on the right and left rear fenders and ”Turbo” on the hood or on the right and left front fenders. At least 900 deaths over a   period were related to   vehicles or ATVs being ridden on paved roads or parking lots, according to the safety commission. During the same period, nearly 3, 000 deaths and 490, 000 injuries related to ATVs and ROVs were reported. Overturning is a common risk when driving an   vehicle on a paved surface, since ATVs and ROVs are designed for   terrains. These vehicles are also more likely to collide with cars, trucks and other vehicles, said the commission. In advance of the holiday weekend, the agency reminded the public that riders need to wear helmets and protective gear, including boots, gloves, eye protectors, long pants and   shirts, and seat belts must be used. Most ATVs are designed for one rider passengers should never exceed seats.  Riders younger than 16 should not drive adult vehicles, and children cannot ride as passengers unless their feet touch the floor in a sitting position, the safety commission said.",

    "text": "(CNN) Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign raised $143 million in August for her campaign, the DNC and state parties, according to a campaign press release, a haul that makes the month the best of her campaign. The fundraising haul is a silver lining on what otherwise was a difficult month for Clinton, where questions about her exclusive use of a private email server as secretary of state and questions about    at the Clinton Foundation hamstrung her campaign. National polls have tightened since the Democratic National Convention in July, but Clinton maintains leads in almost all battleground states. With their massive August haul, the Clinton campaign starts September with more than $68 million in the bank, while her joint fundraising accounts have a combined $84 million in the bank. Clinton campaign unmoved by press squawks over lack of press conferences, ”Thanks to the 2. 3 million people who have contributed to our campaign, we are heading into the final two months of the race with the resources we need to organize and mobilize millions of voters across the country,” Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement. ”These resources will help us to register and turnout millions of voters to elect progressive candidates across the country.” For comparison,  . Barack Obama raised Obama’s campaign raised $66 million in August 2008 and $150 million in September 2008. Clinton headlined 37 fundraisers in August, raising her campaign close to $70 million in the process, according to CNN’s estimate based on average ticket prices and attendance figures provided by the Clinton campaign. Clinton’s events    which took her to 12 states    raised $67. 9 million, according to CNN’s calculations. That haul smashes what she has personally raised during previous months and put her on pace to make August her biggest fundraising month of the campaign. Tom   group targets millennials to help Democrats in North Carolina, One key reason Clinton is able to raise these large sums of money: The Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising account that allows the Democratic ticket to raise money for her campaign, the Democratic National Committee and Democratic state parties at the same time. These agreements allow Clinton’s donors to give $366, 400 to a number of different Democratic accounts through the Clinton campaign. An analysis by Bloomberg found that the Hillary Victory Fund allowed hundreds of donors who had maxed out their donations to the Democratic National Committee to give more money through the joint fundraising agreement. According to the Clinton campaign, $62 million of their total haul in August was for the campaign, while about $81 million was raised for the Democratic National Committee through the Hillary Victory Fund and the Hillary Action Fund. First on CNN:   super PAC reserves $6M in ads aimed at minorities, Clinton’s month was anchored by two   swings    one through California and another through New York. The former secretary of state raised over $19 million during a   nine fundraiser swing through California earlier this month. She topped that haul this week during a similar   nine fundraiser haul through the Hamptons and surrounding towns, bringing in over $21 million in the process. Clinton’s month was   as well.  Debate prep reveals clash of styles for Clinton, Trump, Jimmy Buffett hosted Clinton at his Sag Harbor home earlier this month, serenading the crowd with Sir Paul McCartney, a music icon and one of the frontmen from The Beatles, and Jon Bon Jovi. During her trip to California, Clinton headlined events hosted by singer songwriter Justin Timberlake, actress Jessica Biel, actor Tobey Maguire,   Scooter Braun, Hall of Fame basketball player Magic Johnson and actors Denzel Washington and Samuel L. Jackson. Clinton visited the following states on the fundraising trial this month: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the District of Columbia. Clinton’s biggest fundraiser of the month was a $6. 6 million event in the Hamptons hosted by Jonathan Tisch,   of the New York Giants. Tim Kaine headlined 33 fundraisers this month, bringing in a more modest $12 million, according to estimates, meaning together the   ticket raise around $80 million at fundraisers they personally headlined.",

    "text": "Washington (CNN) Chemical   materials developed during Moammar Gadhafi’s   rule were removed from Libya as part of an international maritime operation, US officials said Thursday. The   operation took place Saturday and was coordinated by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). It was conducted in accordance with a UN resolution at the request of the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) according to a statement issued by National Security Council spokesman Ned Price. Price called the 500 tons that was removed ”the remains of the chemical weapons stockpile accumulated by Moammar Gadhafi’s regime.” A UK naval vessel helped escort the Danish ship bearing the chemicals out of Libya, according to a statement issued by the British government. The Royal Navy ship ”will help ensure chemical weapons precursors do not fall into the hands of extremist groups, including Daesh,” UK Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said, using another term for ISIS. A recent   report accused ISIS of carrying out a chemical weapons attack in Syria. The OPCW said in a statement that the US, along with nine other countries, assisted through the provision of personnel, technical expertise, equipment, financial and other resources. A US defense official told CNN that while it was aware of and supportive of the effort, the US military was not involved in the removal operation.  Meanwhile, the Pentagon said Thursday that forces aligned to the GNA continue to make gains against ISIS in its former stronghold in the coastal city of Sirte, Libya. US Navy Capt. Jeff Davis told reporters that ISIS only retained control over three neighborhoods and that the terror group was being driven into the sea.  ”Literally, their backs are against the ocean,” Davis said, adding that Libyan naval vessels were preventing ISIS from fleeing via the water. Davis estimated that less than 200 ISIS fighters remained in the city. The US has conducted 108 airstrikes against ISIS in Libya since operation Odyssey Lightning began August 1 in at the request of the GNA with four of the strikes taking place Wednesday, Davis said.",

    "text": "(CNN) The new roof at the U. S. Open is being put to good use.  Organizers used the roof    build at a cost of $150 million    for the first time in tournament history in Wednesday’s night session but it proved especially beneficial Thursday after rain hit New York in the morning and afternoon.  In years past, the precipitation would have meant no play at all at the year’s final major, prompting reruns    for TV viewers    of old matches. However, cover over Arthur Ashe stadium ensured the action wasn’t significantly disrupted on the biggest regularly used tennis court in the world.  Play on outer courts was, mind you, severely affected.  Andy Murray usually plays on center court wherever he goes and the Scot was no doubt thrilled to be given a slot on Arthur Ashe stadium given the gloomy forecast.  Murray has appeared in the three previous grand slam finals this season    winning Wimbledon in July    and is the most   player in tennis, having also won singles gold at the Olympics last month. This while world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, affected by wrist and arm injuries, has cooled. Murray progressed to the third round by beating Marcel Granollers       in a competitive 2   hour contest that featured extended rallies and more than a few drop shots from the Spaniard.  Murray    who won the U. S. Open in 2012 after claiming the junior title in 2004    enjoyed his time under the roof although it took the second seed a while to get used to the rain pelting down on the roof.  ”I didn’t know what it was at the beginning,” Murray told Eurosport. ”Neither of us did and then obviously when (we) realized it was the rain there’s nothing you can do about that. It’s so loud. I’ve never played like that before. ”You can’t hear the ball. Tennis players do pick up the sound of the ball to read the spins a little bit earlier and the speed of the serve, so it makes it tricky.  ”It’s something that you need to adjust to and get used to. After a few games it was okay but at the start it’s tricky.” Simona Halep began play on Ashe and in another entertaining tussle, defeated fellow French Open finalist Lucie Safarova    .  ”I had a nice feeling,” Halep told reporters. ”It was a great experience to be there. I didn’t have to wait for the rain, so that’s a good thing.” Halep is considered one of only a sprinkling of players able to challenge Serena Williams for the women’s title, with the list dwindling after Garbine Muguruza    who beat Williams in the French Open final    was upset Wednesday. The Romanian is   in her last 21 matches.  Could Venus Williams win a first major in eight years? There’s still plenty of tennis to be played in New York but the    remains in contention after easing past Germany’s Julia Goerges     to end the day session on Ashe. She will be buoyed by her performance at Wimbledon, having achieved a grand slam semifinal for the first time since 2010.  Visit CNN’s tennis page for more tennis stories, Among winners on the outer courts when the rain relented were 2014 finalist Kei Nishikori and French Open semifinalist Dominic Thiem.",

    "text": "(CNN) Growing gun violence has created a sense of hopelessness in Chicago, a prominent priest and community activist told CNN. ”I had a child asking me to pray for her, that she would not get shot going to school this year,” said the Rev. Michael Pfleger. ”We have more murders here than New York City and Los Angeles together. And we’re lacking a strategy or plan to say how are we going to turn this around.” Ninety people were killed in Chicago in August, the city’s deadliest month for gun violence in 20 years. Now the city looks set to cross a disturbing threshold and easily surpass the number of homicides that occurred in 2015. There have been 474 homicides reported in Chicago this year, compared to 474 in 2015. One of the most shocking killings occurred August 26 when Nykea Aldridge was pushing a baby stroller and was caught in the crossfire of a street shooting. She was the cousin of Dwyane Wade, the   NBA   who recently signed a contract with his hometown Chicago Bulls. Pfleger, a pastor at Saint Sabina Church and a social activist on Chicago’s South Side, compared the killings to a natural disaster.  ”We have a flood and fire and earthquake of violence and blood on our streets,” he said. Chicago violence: The disturbing numbers, Police are frustrated, too, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said police officers are highly upset by the violence and the community response. Witnesses to gun violence very often are not willing to talk with investigators, Johnson said. ”These men and women are working their tails off out there,” he said of the police force. ”And I’ll tell  you this, it’s frustrating for them to arrest a guy on Friday for an illegal gun and then the next Thursday they see him right back out on the street with another illegal gun.” Cooperation and communication between law enforcement and the community also needs to be addressed, Pfleger said. ”Never in my life in Chicago    and I’m raised in Chicago    have I seen the relationship between law enforcement and police and the community worse than it is right now,” he said. Pfleger: Huge trust gap between police and public, Pfleger said the same problems exist in the American cities with the biggest violence problems. ”You see double digit unemployment. You see poorly funded and under performing schools. ... You see abandoned buildings and communities that look like third world countries. You see a proliferation of guns, no options or opportunities, no economic development.” Solving gun violence in Chicago requires a comprehensive approach, he said. ”Unless we have the courage to change the playing field, we are not going to see an end to this,” Pfleger said.  In response to the violence, Mayor Rahm Emanuel plans to hire hundreds of new police officers, the Chicago Tribune has reported. Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner recently signed a new gun control that imposes stiffer penalties on anyone without a   identification card who brings a gun into the state intending to sell it.",

The British driver outpaced Mercedes teammate and title rival Nico Rosberg, who will start second on the grid for Sunday’s Italian Grand Prix, by close to half a second. ”I was right in the sweet spot today and I was able to get an exceptional lap time out of it,” Hamilton said in comments carried by the AFP news agency. ”What this team has achieved in phenomenal.” READ: The death that rocked F1, Hamilton currently leads the driver’s standings by nine points, having trailed Rosberg at one stage by 43 points.

    "text": "(CNN) Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims are expected to gather in Rome to witness the canonization of Mother Teresa, the nun who dedicated her life to helping the poor in India. The canonization mass, held by Pope Francis, will take place Sunday morning in St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City. A number of bishops from both Albania, where Mother Teresa was born in 1910, and India are due to attend, as well as state leaders. The crowd is anticipated to surpass the 300, 000 that attended Pope John Paul II’s beatification of Mother Teresa in Rome in 2003.  ”Brothers and sisters, even in our days God inspires new models of sainthood,” John Paul told the crowd at the time. Speeding up sainthood  Most of the Catholic Church’s saints or blessed people are honored decades, if not centuries, after their deaths. Traditionally, there is a mandatory   waiting period before formal evaluation of a candidate for beatification can begin.  Mother Teresa’s devotees began pressing the Vatican soon after her death to speed up the nun’s sainthood cause, saying her holiness was clear to many around the world. Pope John Paul II granted the special dispensation in 1999, and the procedure began.  The pope waived the waiting period in part, some believe, because of her fame and reputation. John Paul II further paved the way for her beatification in 2002, when he approved a miracle attributed to Mother Teresa after her death.  The approved miracle involved Monica Besra, a    Kolkata woman who said praying to the nun cured a stomach tumor. The Vatican committee said in October 2002 that it could find no ”scientific explanation” for the woman’s recovery. ”I took doctors’ medicines, threw up and was in a lot of pain. But when I prayed to Mother Teresa from my heart, Mother Teresa blessed me and now I am healthy,” Besra told CNN last week.  ”My entire village and I am very happy that she is being made a saint.” Pope Francis formally announced that Mother Teresa would be declared a saint in March 2016, when he recognized a second miracle attributed to her.   A Brazilian man with multiple brain tumors was healed after loved ones prayed to Mother Teresa to heal him, according to Avvenire, a newspaper affiliated to the Catholic Church. ’Saint of the gutters’  Born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in 1910, Mother Teresa set up her Missionaries of Charity in the slums of Kolkata in 1950 and made her headquarters in the Indian city for nearly half a century. When a legendary photographer met an iconic missionary  Her small figure in a    sari and sandals became familiar around the world. She died in Kolkata in 1997 at age 87. Known as the ”Saint of the Gutters” for her unending work and compassion for the poor, Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979. The Norwegian Nobel Committee said her spirit and the respect she had for the worth and dignity of human beings inspired constructive efforts to do away with hunger and poverty. However, Mother Teresa’s legacy has been criticized. Her critics say her charity isn’t financially accountable and volunteers aren’t properly trained. And some doctors claim Besra was healed by modern medicine, not by prayer.   READ: Mother Teresa, my mom, The nuns and priests from the Missionaries of Charity continue her work around the world, including some   countries where she was banned. Her order has offices in Europe, Africa, the Americas and Australia, as well as Hong Kong and Russia.

    "text": "(CNN) Fred Hellerman, a singer and composer who was the last surviving member of the iconic and influential folk music quartet the Weavers, has died. The musician passed away on Thursday ”after a long run of failing health” and was at ”home and surrounded by family” when he died, his son Caleb Hellerman said on his Facebook page. Fred Hellerman was 89 and lived in Weston, Connecticut. Hellerman, Pete Seeger, Ronnie Gilbert and Lee Hays formed the Weavers in the late 1940s and recorded many folk standards, such as  ”If I Had a Hammer,” ”On Top of Old Smoky,” ”Goodnight, Irene,” ”The Lion Sleeps Tonight” (also known as ”Wimoweh”) and ”Tzena, Tzena, Tzena,”   Hellerman played guitar and sang for the group, which set the stage for a folk music wave in the 1950s and 1960s. Popular, then blacklisted, Despite the Weavers’ popularity, the group had been targeted by   and was blacklisted during the McCarthy era. ”They were forced to take a hiatus from their recording career due to the blacklist, until their return for their iconic Christmas Eve 1955 concert at Carnegie Hall,  according to CNN affiliate WCBS. After Seeger left the Weavers in 1958, Gilbert, Hays and Hellerman went on with other singers until the group disbanded in 1964. After that, members reunited to perform. The Grammys gave the group a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006, and an article on its website called the group ”seminal” and said the members ”fought back against political intolerance.” ”If this award to us has any message, it’s that if you stay the course you can outlast your enemies with your honor and dignity intact,” Hellerman said at the time. Yiddish theater spurs love of music, Born in Brooklyn on May 13, 1927, Hellerman ”first displayed his love for music by collaborating on stage plays in the Yiddish theater,” WCBS said, citing Hellerman’s son. He attended Brooklyn College and served in the U. S. Coast Guard during World War II, according to the Internet Movie Database. His AllMusic. com bio said he taught himself to play guitar during his Coast Guard stint. Hellerman was an arranger and songwriter for other performers. He produced Arlo Guthrie’s 1967 record ”Alice’s Restaurant.” There won’t be a funeral but a memorial service    with music    will be held in the next few months, Hellerman’s son said.

    "text": "(CNN) Police in the Philippines are looking for a man and two women they want to question in connection with the  blast at a crowded market in Davao City that killed 14 people. National Police Chief Ronald dela Rosa told CNN on Saturday the blast late Friday was caused by an improvised explosive device made of mortar rounds    which pointed to extremist groups. Escalating ISIS threat in Southeast Asia: Is the Philippines a weak link? Dela Rosa told reporters in the southern Philippines city that authorities had eight witnesses, and a sketch of one suspect.   people were injured at the crowded night market in President Rodrigo Duterte’s hometown, Dela Rosa said. Fifteen of the injured were in critical condition, CNN Philippines reported, citing Southern Philippines Medical Center director Leopoldo Vega. Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte    the President’s son    said the city had received a bomb threat two days before the blast, CNN affiliate   reported. Members of the UN Security Council called the attack ”heinous” and ”cowardly,” and said ”those responsible for these killings should be held accountable,” according to a press statement issued on Sunday. Islamists are uspected, On Saturday morning, during a visit to the blast site, Duterte told reporters that Islamist militants could be responsible. ”We are not new to this kind. It is always connected with the Abu Sayyaf or in Central Mindanao,” he said, according to a statement from his office. ”But this is not the first time that Davao City has been sacrificed in the altar of violence.”  He said he had warned the public that there could be blowback from intensified government military operations against the   Islamist group Abu Sayyaf in Sulu province, where 8, 000 troops deployed in recent weeks. ”We have always been ready for this. I warned, I remember warning everybody that there could be a reprisal because of the pressure there in Sulu which is going on,” Duterte said. Abu Sayyaf is a violent extremist group that split from the established Philippines separatist movement Moro National Liberation Front in 1991. The group, which remains outside the country’s sputtering peace process, has the stated aim of establishing an independent Islamic state on the southern island of Mindanao, on which Davao City is located. The group first became active in the early 1990s and was responsible for bombings across the southern Philippines and in the Malaysian state of Sabah, and more recently has gained headlines for kidnapping and beheading Western hostages. The Philippines is a predominantly Catholic country, with a large Muslim population in the south. Abu Sayyaf: Islamist extremists or profiteering criminals? ’State of lawlessness’ Duterte has described the attack as an act of terrorism, and declared the nation in ”a state of lawlessness,” authorizing police and the military to search cars and frisk people at checkpoints.  The ”state of lawlessness” is the mildest of the three executive powers the President can order, giving him the power to summon the military and work more closely with police, but falls short of being a declaration of martial law. The president can only impose martial law in case of invasion or rebellion, Duterte’s spokesman said. ”It’s not martial law but I am inviting now the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the military and the police to run the country in accordance with my specifications,” he said, according to CNN Philippines. Duterte, who visited a morgue early Saturday to pay respects to the dead, said people should submit to searches and frisking at checkpoints for the sake of public safety. ”We know that this is not a fascist state. I cannot control the movement of the citizens of the city and every Filipino has the right to enter and leave Davao. It is unfortunate we cannot stop and frisk anybody for just any reason,” he said. Police and military are on high alert across the country, and authorities have urged the public to be vigilant in case of further attacks. Duterte’s war on drugs, Duterte, the longtime mayor of Davao City, has faced domestic and international criticism since taking national office for his hardline stance on suspected drug offenders. Rodrigo Duterte promised to fight drug dealers, The Philippine Daily Inquirer’s ”Kill List”    regarded as one of the most accurate records of the killings of suspected drug dealers by police and vigilantes    has recorded 832 deaths since Duterte assumed office June 30. Police say at least 239 drug suspects were killed in the three weeks after Duterte’s inauguration. Duterte’s war on drugs leaves bodies in the street, ’I am really scared’ Leonor Rala, a    medical technology student at San Pedro College, told CNN Friday night that she was terrified after the blast struck near her dorm. She said she initially thought something had fallen on the roof of a neighboring building. She went down to survey the scene of the blast, about 100 yards from her dorm. Emergency teams were already in place. ”I am really scared to go out,” she said. ”Some of my schoolmates are victims of the explosion and now dead.” She continued: ”We’re very terrified because Davao City was known to be the safest city in the Philippines and a situation like this is very rare.”",

    "text": "(CNN) The FBI’s public release of the report of its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, including Clinton’s own FBI interview, provides striking revelations about her private server and her handling of classified information.  More significantly, the FBI report includes evidence of the possibility that Clinton, or those acting on her behalf, unlawfully destroyed federal records.  At the very least, the release of the FBI report    combined with the thousands of emails the FBI recovered during its investigation that Clinton failed to hand over and that the State Department is currently reviewing for possible public release    will ensure that the Clinton email controversy remains an issue through the November election. Extremely careless, but not criminal, The FBI report provides new details about the complexity of the FBI’s investigation and gives additional context for FBI Director James Comey’s earlier statements that Clinton’s handling of classified information was ”extremely careless,” but that the FBI was unable to find evidence sufficient to recommend criminal charges.  The FBI report identifies, for example, multiple servers used to house Clinton’s emails over time and found evidence of numerous attempts at unauthorized access by unknown parties. The FBI also found that Clinton used up to 13 different mobile devices during the relevant time period and that she and her attorneys were unable to locate any of these mobile devices for the purposes of its investigation.  The FBI also notes that when confronted during her interview with emails containing classification markings, Clinton said she did not understand that ”(C)” markings indicated the presence of classified ”Confidential” information. For a former secretary of state (and senator with significant experience working with classified materials) Clinton’s assertion that she did not understand the meaning of these markings strains credulity and will further feed concerns that her responses to this controversy have lacked candor. Clinton’s FBI interview also contains a discussion, left partially unredacted, regarding information on drone strikes. This strongly suggests that press reports indicating that some of the most highly classified emails found on Clinton’s private server related to drone strike deliberations are accurate. These may well have been the emails FBI Director Comey referred to that Clinton and her aides ”should have known” did not belong on an unclassified system.  Were federal records destroyed? Of perhaps greater significance going forward are crucial new details about the destruction of emails that may have constituted federal records.  Clinton told the FBI that she was aware that her use of a personal email ”did not negate her obligation to preserve federal records.” She even noted that former Secretary of State Colin Powell advised her in 2009 that if she used private email to ”do business” her emails would be records ”subject to the law.” Yet, the FBI investigation illustrates how Clinton repeatedly failed to fulfill her legal obligations under the federal records laws. The FBI report references, for example, the earlier finding of the State Department Inspector General that Clinton violated the federal records laws by failing to surrender her   emails to the State Department when she left office in 2013.   The FBI investigation further reveals the highly questionable   of both Clinton and her attorneys in how they reviewed Clinton’s emails when the State Department subsequently requested their return in 2014.   Clinton has repeatedly justified not having an impartial review of her emails to determine which constituted federal records by pointing to the fact that government employees routinely make such determinations given that they are best placed to assess the relevance and significance of such records.   Yet Clinton revealed to the FBI that when she directed her private attorneys to locate   emails, she ”did not participate in the development of the specific process to be used” and that she was never ”consulted on specific emails in order to determine if they were  .”  Problems with review by Clinton lawyers  Moreover, the FBI highlights significant problems with the adequacy and integrity of the process her attorneys used. The initial review was not based on the content of each individual email, but on key word searches and header information, a process that almost guaranteed that some federal records would be overlooked.   Another revelation came from an attorney working under Clinton’s senior attorneys David Kendall and Cheryl Mills. The lawyer, who conducted the initial review, told the FBI that Kendall and Mills would review emails that had been identified as   and would sometimes overrule that determination. The hard copies of such emails were ”shredded” and not included in the emails presented by Clinton to the State Department. The standard her private attorneys used in making such decisions is unknown and now shrouded in   privilege. Finally, after the review was complete,   of these determinations was precluded by Clinton’s decision in December 2014 to have her server deleted and wiped clean. The most stunning revelation of the FBI report is that the company housing the server did not actually destroy these emails until late March 2015, after the public controversy over the server had already begun and after a Congressional demand to preserve them.  While Clinton denied knowledge of this fact in her FBI interview, the FBI found evidence of a conference call between Clinton attorneys and the server company roughly contemporaneous with this destruction.   The FBI investigation through forensic examinations and other sources recovered over 17, 000 emails that Clinton failed to hand over to the State Department. Most of these are currently undergoing a review by the State Department for possible public release, which will attract close scrutiny to the extent they constitute substantive federal records that should not have been destroyed or contain information Clinton might have wanted to conceal. To be clear, the recovery and review of such emails may well provide evidence of an unlawful destruction of federal records, but it will likely still be insufficient to show a criminal act. The relevant criminal law prohibiting the destruction or concealment of federal records has been interpreted to require that there was a specific intent to violate the law.  And Clinton’s carefully crafted statement in her FBI interview that she ”never deleted, nor did she instruct anyone to delete, her email to avoid complying with the Federal Records Act, FOIA, or State or FBI requests for information” seems tailored to avoid this law. Yet while FBI Director Comey also stated that the FBI ”found no evidence that any of the additional   emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them,” he also made clear that violations of the federal records laws were not the subject of the FBI’s investigation. A separate criminal referral arising out of an inquiry by the National Archives into the federal records laws is possible, although unlikely.  In the end, while many voters may have already reached fatigue over the issue of Clinton’s emails or may have already made up their minds regarding its significance, the facts will continue to drip out. While concerns about Clinton’s judgment in this matter may not alter the decisions of some voters when compared to broader judgment concerns about her Republican opponent, Clinton’s actions raise reasonable concerns about her views on transparency and good government    and those concerns would be relevant in a possible Clinton administration.",

    "text": "(CNN) On Labor Day, it’s time to celebrate the contributions of immigrants to America’s bountiful economy.   This is not the message you hear from Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. During his speech about immigration, in which  Trump defied predictions that he was about to make his   pivot to moderation, he doubled down on his hardline stance against immigration. Surrounding himself with parents and family whose loved ones had been killed by undocumented ”illegal aliens,” Trump reiterated his hardline opposition to immigrants and outlined the reasons why he thought President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s positions are destructive.   Although he backed away from earlier primary claims that he would deport 12 million illegal immigrants, now saying that only 2 million criminals would be getting the boot, that was not much of a concession. He stood firmly against embracing a path to citizenship and his fierce rhetoric belied any possibility that he was turning some corner.   At one key point in the speech, Trump undertook a Nixonian move by pitting immigrants against working Americans. He said: ”If we’re going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns of working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.”   By separating working people from immigrants, Trump ignores something that is fundamental to the history of the United States. Immigrants have been the backbone of our economy from the very start of the Republic. Unless one stipulates that workers can only be white and native born, his argument doesn’t hold water.   Immigrants have been a driving force in the work of America. We are a country founded by immigrants and refugees who came here and settled the colonies, seeking new opportunities.   During the 1840s and 1860s, Chinese immigrants were central to the construction of the railway system which became the heart of the American economy. Scottish immigrants settled in Midwestern states where they farmed the land. Many were perceived to be the most efficient and effective farmers of the period. German and Irish immigrants who flocked to the cities provided the manpower behind the construction of our urban infrastructure and creation of our financial system. They were there at the start as the steel and coal industry propelled the US into a major economic power.   These immigrants were joined by another wave who followed them seeking opportunity as well as freedom. Between the 1880s and 1920s, immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe constituted the unskilled labor that fueled most of the major areas of economic growth, from the automobile industry to the garment industry.   Some of the most important labor leaders to emerge from these years, such as Sidney Hillman, arrived from overseas (Hillman was born in Lithuania). Even after nativists closed the doors to these groups in the 1920s, Mexican Americans kept arriving to the US as many farmers in the Southwest depended on them to keep their businesses running. When the Eisenhower administration tried to crack down on these communities through the brutal ”Operation Wetback” deportation program, the president ultimately failed and the INS increased the number of Bracero visas given to workers.   The same pattern has been true since the immigration reform of 1965, as the influx of newcomers from Latin America and Asia have been pivotal to filling lower wage positions in the service economy as well as more lucrative positions in tech. A large percentage of the doctorate programs in science and engineering, which most agree are essential to innovation, are filled with foreign students. One study found that between 2006 and 2012, there was at least one founder born overseas in   of all   tech companies in Silicon Valley.    There is a reason business has historically supported liberal immigration policies. Immigrants expand the workforce. In current times, immigrants have encouraged the creation of more business  . The Small Business Administration reported that immigrants were 30% more likely than non immigrants to start a business. Immigrants spend money, boosting consumer demand. Studies consistently show that immigrants don’t take jobs away from those who are already here, instead doing jobs that are otherwise unfilled, and overall they boost the strength of the industries where they work, allowing owners to employ even more people.       Immigrants have not only been pivotal at the lower and middle levels of the labor force, but they have also proven to be some of the greatest titans of industry. Most famously, the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie came to the US after growing up in poverty in Scotland. Starting work in a cotton mill at age 13, Carnegie became one of the most powerful players in the economy. Louis Mayer, one of the founders of Hollywood, our most beloved American product, was born in Russia and came to the US in his late teens.   Today there are many economic power brokers who came from abroad or grew up in immigrant families. Sergey Brin, the   of Google, came to the United States from Moscow at the age of 6. Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk arrived in the States from South Africa.   Don Won and Jim Sook, the   of Forever 21, a popular clothing store, arrived from Korea in 1981. Don Won started working in janitorial jobs before he and his wife opened their first store in 1981. Josie Natori, who arrived from the Philippines in 1965 to attend Manhattanville College and became a citizen in 1974, founded the Natori Company that sold sleepwear to stores including Target. Jose Wilfredo Flores, who came to Philadelphia from El Salvador at 14 years of age is the owner and founder of W Concrete, which earns several million a year.   If you use WhatsApp to communicate with your friends, you can thank Jan Koum, who came here with his mother from a small village in Ukraine to live in a   apartment, and if you like soft drinks, you’ve benefited from the work of PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, who grew up in Madras, India. Linda Alvarado, the president and CEO of Alvarado Construction and   of the Colorado Rockies, grew up in a Latino family in New Mexico. Besides the economy, immigrants have continually enriched our politics, our culture, and our society. The story of the United States is a story of an immigrant nation.   So on this Labor Day, in the middle of a campaign where immigrants, legal and illegal, have been blasted with a ferocity that has taken many people by surprise, it might be good to pause and remember just how vital they have been to the making of our economy.   While Trump argued that workers and immigrants are in opposition, in fact they are the same. We are all immigrants in this nation and each generation makes new contributions to our success. Instead of castigating, it’s time to start celebrating.",

    "text": "(CNN) A British woman murdered in a suspected ”honor killing” incident in Pakistan was raped before her death, Pakistani police say.  And a local policeman who first investigated the   ’s death has been arrested on suspicion of suppressing evidence from witnesses and allowing key suspects to flee the country, Abubakar Khuda Bux, deputy inspector general of Lahore police told CNN. Samia Shahid, from Bradford, England, was visiting family in the Jhelum district in Pakistan’s northern Punjab province in July when she was killed.  Her relatives initially told local police she had a heart attack, but a   showed she had been strangled, Punjab police spokeswoman Nabeela Ghazanfar told CNN.  Haq Nawaz, Shahid’s uncle, has been taken into police custody in Jhelum for trying to cover up how his niece was killed. Ghazanfar told CNN he tried to mislead police by telling them the murdered beautician had died of natural causes.  Shahid’s former husband, Chaudhry Muhammad Shakeel, was held on suspicion of murder, and confessed last month to having strangled her to death with her scarf, Ghazanfar said. Shakeel was also Shahid’s first cousin. The dead woman’s father, Chaudhary Shahid, has also been remanded on suspicion of having been an accessory to her murder, Ghazanfar said. He is accused of having lured his daughter to Pakistan under false pretenses when she was murdered. Ghazanfar told CNN that both men will be prosecuted for the Briton’s murder at a court hearing next week.   Widower: ’I want justice’ Shahid’s second husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazam, told CNN he believed his wife was killed in a   honor killing, because her family disapproved of their marriage.  He said his late wife’s father had summoned her to Pakistan from Dubai, where the couple had been living for 16 months, by claiming to have been seriously unwell. He said he believed his late wife’s immediate family were aware of the plan to murder her.  ”I’m devastated,” he said, ”I want justice for Samia. Women have their own rights and own will. They are not prisoners. Killing a daughter is not the solution.”  The slain woman’s mother and sister are believed to have left Pakistan and are wanted by police for questioning, Bux said. British lawmaker Naz Shah, who was Shahid’s local member of parliament, wrote to the Pakistani government in July asking for help to bring the perpetrators to justice.  On hearing that Shahid had been raped before being murdered, she told CNN: ”This just adds to the depth of this crime and the levels of evilness. I’m pleased to hear the inspector in charge of the local police station has been arrested for allowing Samia’s mother and sister to abscond.”",

    "text": "(CNN) An alleged gang member opened fire while he was visiting a county jail in California, leaving two veteran correctional officers critically wounded,  authorities said.  Officers Juanita Davila and Toamalama Scanlan were hospitalized after the shooting Saturday at the Fresno County Jail.  The Fresno County sheriff’s office is accepting donations on behalf of the two wounded officers and does not plan any changes in the handling of jail security, spokesman Tony Botti said Sunday. ”It is obviously a difficult time for all of us, especially for the family members of officers Scanlan and Davila,” Botti said. ”Many have asked if any immediate changes will be made at the jail in terms of security provisions.  The answer is no, not at this time.” The office executive staff is still reviewing the circumstances surrounding the double shooting, Botti said. The incident started when suspect Thong Vang, who was visiting someone at the jail, entered the lobby, the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office said.  He tried to cut to the front of the line, but a correctional officer at the front desk told him to wait his turn, it said.  At that point, the suspect started pacing back and forth near a metal detector that leads to a secure area of the jail, authorities said.  ’Held at gunpoint’ Davila and Scanlan told the suspect to take a seat, but he allegedly refused and started struggling with them. The suspect then pulled out a gun and shot the officers, according to authorities.  ”The suspect dropped his weapon and was held at gunpoint while other deputies rescued the two injured correctional officers by dragging them out of the lobby to ambulances waiting outside,” the Sheriff’s Office said.  Deputies detained Vang and took him to a hospital with minor scrapes and cuts. He was charged Saturday night with attempted murder, possession of a firearm by a felon and bringing drugs in jail, court records show.  It was not immediately clear who his attorney was.  The suspect is a known gang member and a registered sex offender, according to authorities.  ”In 1998, he was sentenced to 19 years in prison on multiple rape charges involving teenagers aged 14 and under.  He served 16 years of his time and was released on Sept. 4, 2014.  He has not had any criminal violations until today,” the Sheriff’s Office said.  The Fresno County Jail is closed to visitors until further notice.",

    "text": "(CNN) England left it until the last minute to beat   Slovakia in the opening game of the World Cup qualifiers. Adam Lallana scored the winner    his first for the national team    with a weak shot that crept through the goalkeeper’s legs in the final moments of stoppage time at Trnava. But the first game under new manager Sam Allardyce will have done little to encourage England fans hoping to see a side rejuvenated after a dismal campaign in the Euros in the summer, culminating in a shock defeat to Iceland. England’s fans underwhelmed, England’s draw was widely derided on Twitter as England struggled to overcome a Slovakian side that was reduced to 10 men when Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel was sent off early in the second half after a second yellow card for stamping on England striker Harry Kane. England struggled to break down the Slovakian defense and it wasn’t until the 64th minute that any kind of effort hit the target. The performance also prompted a sarcastic tweet from former England captain and TV sport presenter Gary Lineker who said: ”Massive step forward for England. After losing to Iceland we’ve now beaten a country with 15 times their population. We’re back!” The evening was a struggle for Poland too. It could only draw    away at Kazakhstan after squandering a   lead. Bartosz Kapustka and Robert Lewandowski put Poland into a comfortable lead at half time but Sergey Khiznichenko scored twice in the second half to level the match. There were no surprises in the later   with Germany easily beating Norway   and Scotland crushing Malta   with help from a Robert Snodgrass  . The Czech Republic held Northern Ireland to a goalless draw, and San Marino    so often the whipping boys in international matches    only lost by a single goal to Azerbaijan. Denmark beat Armenia by a goal to nil and Lithuania drew   with Slovenia.",

It took four hours and a   tiebreak to upset the world No. 5, which earns the    a quarterfinal berth, alongside compatriots Gael Monfils and   Tsonga. He will meet Monfils in the next round. Pouille refused to be drawn on the   impact of his historic win over the   slam winner. ”Maybe it will change my career, but I will see,” he said.  ”It will give me a lot of confidence for the next round, for the rest of the season.” The world No. 25 faltered briefly during the fifth set before recovering to win the             ( ) and secure an historic victory over a player who hasn’t missed a quarterfinal date in 12 years.  Pouille also made the quarterfinals at Wimbledon earlier this year, but to beat a player of Nadal’s stature will rank as perhaps his greatest   achievement.  Sevastova inks in QF date, Elsewhere at Flushing Meadows, unseeded Latvian Anastasija Sevastova, currently ranked 48th in the world, created her own upset Sunday when she knocked out the British 13th seed Johanna Konta. Her     win earns the    a last eight tie with Dane Caroline Wozniacki, who also sailed through her match, beating eighth seed Madison Keys    . Konta did not appear to be at her best in the Arthur Ashe Stadium. She collapsed on court during her   victory at Flushing Meadows. ”I’m sure there are some remnants of it but it’s not the reason I lost today,” Konta told reporters. My opponent played an overall more solid match than I did,” she said. Wozniacki made the final at Flushing Meadows in 2009 and 2014 but a series of fitness problems, including an ankle injury earlier this year, have seen her drop to 74th in the world rankings. It is the second time in the tournament that Sevastova has upset the form book. She knocked out third seed Garbine Muguruza in the second round. On the US Open website, Sevastova said she has been fighting hard for victory after recovering from a string of injuries since her layoff in 2013. ”But now, I’m back,” she said. Seventh seed Roberta Vinci (Italy) is also through to the quarters after beating Ukrainian Lesia Tsurenko     and will now face either second seed Angelique Kerber (Germany) or Czech player Petra Kvitova in the next round.

    "text": "(CNN) Imprisoned former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning has learned that she will receive gender transition surgery, her lawyer told CNN, in what could make her the first US prison inmate to undergo such a procedure. Manning, a transgender woman, was convicted of stealing and disseminating 750, 000 pages of documents and videos to WikiLeaks.  The former US Army soldier is serving a   sentence at Fort Leavenworth, an   Army prison in eastern Kansas, despite her request to transfer to a civilian prison. Her lawyers say she has been denied medical treatment for her gender dysphoria, a condition in which there is a conflict between a person’s physical sex and the gender he or she identifies with.  The government’s refusal to treat her for her condition led to a suicide attempt in July, her lawyers said. Manning began a hunger strike on September 9 to demand treatment and access to medically prescribed recommendations for her condition. It ended on Tuesday when she received word that the military will provide treatment for her gender dysphoria, beginning with surgery recommended by her psychologist, according to the ACLU, which is representing Manning. The Army declined to confirm the claim, saying ”We cannot and will not discuss the medical needs of individuals.” A new Department of Defense policy, which takes effect in October, lays out processes under which service members may transition. Under the policy, ”service members with a diagnosis from a military medical provider indicating that gender transition is medically necessary will be provided medical care and treatment for the diagnosed medical condition.” It is not clear if or how the policy applies to inmates like Manning. ’This is all that I wanted’ Manning told her lawyers that she expects ”to meet with a team of doctors in the next week or two to move the process forward to prepare for surgery,” ACLU attorney Chase Strangio said in an email. No ”concrete timeline was given,” he said. The development could make Manning the first transgender person to receive gender affirming surgical treatment in any US prison, military, state or federal, the ACLU said. Manning began publicly identifying as a woman in August 2013, the day after her sentencing. She filed a lawsuit in 2014 against the Department of Defense so she could grow out her hair, use cosmetics and receive hormone treatment ”in order to express her female gender.”  Last year, the Army agreed to provide her with hormone therapy but would not allow her to groom as a woman. ”I am unendingly relieved that the military is finally doing the right thing. I applaud them for that. This is all that I wanted  —   for them to let me be me,” Manning said in a statement through the ACLU.  ”But it is hard not to wonder why it has taken so long. Also, why were such drastic measures needed? The surgery was recommended in April 2016. The recommendations for my hair length were back in 2014. In any case, I hope this sets a precedent for the thousands of trans people behind me hoping they will be given the treatment they need.” ’Absolutely vital care’ Manning’s lawyer said she still faces charges related to her suicide attempt. Her hearing will be held on September 20, he said in a tweet.  ”This is a monumental day for Chelsea, who can now enjoy some peace knowing that critically needed medical care is forthcoming. This medical care is absolutely vital for Chelsea as it is for so many transgender people  —   in and out of prison  —   who are systemically denied treatment solely because they are transgender,” he said in a statement. ”Thankfully the government has recognized its constitutional obligation to provide Chelsea with the medical care that she needs and we hope that they will act without delay to ensure that her suffering does not needlessly continue.”",

    "text": "(CNN) A nervous calm appears to have descended on Syria on the first full day of a ceasefire, but aid has not yet been able to reach besieged populations. Aid agencies stand poised to distribute   assistance but say they are awaiting guarantees of security from all parties before beginning their deliveries to hundreds of thousands of desperate Syrians. The Syrian Foreign Ministry says it refuses any entry of humanitarian aid to the city of Aleppo, a priority for aid agencies, unless it is coordinated through the Syrian government and United Nations    especially aid coming from Turkey, the   Syrian Arab News Agency reported. Staffan de Mistura, UN special envoy for Syria, told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, that there has been a ”significant drop in violence” and that the ”situation has dramatically improved, with no airstrikes.”  He said humanitarian aid has not yet been delivered because the Syrian government hasn’t sent a letter of authorization to the United Nations.  International Committee of the Red Cross spokeswoman Krista Armstrong said supplies were in warehouses ready to be delivered to   east Aleppo and other besieged areas as soon as they were cleared to enter. Between 250, 000 and 275, 000 people in east Aleppo have been cut off from assistance since early July, according to the United Nations.  But she said that ”there hasn’t been a breakthrough in accessing new areas” without any guarantees on security. Jens Laerke, deputy spokesman for the UN humanitarian office, said the United Nations called on all parties to respect the cessation of hostilities ”to enable unimpeded, unconditional and sustained access without delay.” ”We hope and are prepared to commence those deliveries as soon as we are satisfied that the cessation of hostilities holds and that safe deliveries can be made,” he said. The first planned deliveries will provide food assistance to east Aleppo, delivered across the border from Turkey, he said. IDF: Syrian claim to have shot down Israeli warplane, drone is ’total lies’ Ceasefire coincides with Muslim holiday  The peace appeared to be holding Tuesday, with no major violence reported on the first full day of a   ceasefire brokered by the United States and Russia. Both the Syrian government and opposition groups reported sporadic incidents in the first few hours after the ceasefire went into effect at sundown (11. 45 a. m. ET) Monday.  One monitoring group reported five violations occurred in and around Aleppo in the ceasefire’s first hours, while   news agency SANA said rebels were responsible for a number of breaches in Aleppo and Homs. But such violations are not uncommon in the early hours of a ceasefire, and eventually, the weapons largely fell silent.  Residents of Aleppo, Idlib and Homs, accustomed to the buzz of regime military jets overhead, told CNN that the warplanes had vanished from the skies in the hours following the ceasefire, with only the occasional mortar to be heard. On Eid   Syria’s children laugh again, The ceasefire’s start coincides with the beginning of Eid      a holiday that commemorates when Ibrahim (Abraham in the Old Testament) prepares to sacrifice his son as God commanded, but God intervenes and stops him at the last moment. The Feast of the Sacrifice celebrates the value of human life. It follows a weekend during which more than 90 people    including 28 children    were killed in airstrikes.  The terms of the deal, The deal calls for a halt to the violence between the Syrian regime and rebel forces, but does not cover militant groups considered terrorists, such as ISIS and Jabhat Fateh   formerly known as al Nusra Front.  It is hoped the ceasefire will provide a window for the delivery of aid to the hundreds of thousands of Syrians in desperate need of food, medicine and other essentials. Under the terms of the deal, if the peace holds for seven days, then Russia and the United States will begin coordination to target terror groups in the conflict. US Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday said while the start of the ceasefire looked good, ”it is far too early to draw any definitive conclusions.” Just hours before the ceasefire started, Syrian President Bashar   gave a defiant message to the country’s opposition forces, vowing ”to retake every piece of land from the terrorists.” Assad’s family has ruled Syria for 45 years. He has often referred to opposition members seeking his ouster as terrorists. Syria ceasefire: Will this one be any different? Kerry: ’This is less than perfect’ The ceasefire is the second such concerted attempt to bring peace to Syria this year. The United States and Russia coordinated a partial ceasefire in February, but violence soon resumed. In the wake of the earlier failures, Kerry addressed criticism that the latest deal is flawed. ”Sure, this is less than perfect,” he said. ”But flawed compared to what? Compared to nothing?  ”This catastrophe developed step by step, folks, and it can only be reversed step by step. This is the best thing we could think of.”   Inside Jarablus: What happens when ISIS loses control of a city, The Syrian civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced more than 5 million to flee the country, spawning an international refugee crisis.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a   monitoring group, estimates that up to 430, 000 people have been killed in the conflict, although an accurate estimate is almost impossible to obtain. The group says it has documented 301, 781 deaths in Syria, from March 18, 2011, until September 12, 2016, when the latest truce went into effect. But the group’s founder, Rami Abdulrahman, said the actual number of deaths is closer to 430, 000.  Among the documented deaths were 86, 692 civilians    15, 099 children under 18 and 10, 018 women, he said. The dead included more than 52, 000 fighters from other countries, he said. A statement from US Central Command acknowledged that some civilians appear to have been killed recently in strikes against ISIS targets in Syria. In two of the three incidents a ”nonmilitary” vehicle entered the strike zone after an aircraft fired on the targets. In another strike near Raqqa, some civilians who were near the target may have been killed, CENTCOM said.",

    "text": "(CNN) When an ”overheated and dehydrated” Hillary Clinton stumbled into a van as she left a   memorial ceremony on Sunday morning, conspiracy theorists rejoiced.  A few hours later, after it was revealed she had come down with pneumonia    a common illness now being treated with antibiotics and a few days’ rest    they got back to work, retrofitting baseless and lurid suggestions about her health. The weekend wobble was treated by some political rivals and online antagonists as validation    proof positive that the Democratic nominee was unfit, in the most literal terms, for the presidency.  A shadow campaign pushing rumors that Clinton is hiding a grave illness to protect her White House aspirations has existed for years, but only found a voice and   champions during the last few months of this general election contest.  Even as Clinton took a brief leave from the stump    she is set to resume travel on Thursday    her campaign wrestled with legitimate questions about a lack of transparency during the Sunday scare, the rumor mill churned apace.  Donald Trump, who has considerably been less open about his health, was mostly restrained in the aftermath    though he did couch his well wishes with some goading analysis, saying on Monday: ”I just see what I see    the coughing fit was a week ago, so I assume that was pneumonia also.”  Or not. Facts have rarely gotten in the way of dubious suggestions about Clinton’s health. In a letter released Wednesday, her physician made a point of stating that the candidate ”is in excellent mental condition.”  Here    quite apart from any legitimate concern stemming from her recent illness    are a few of the more ludicrous and resilient theories: Whatever might be wrong, it’s now being covered up by . .. a body double! In the aftermath of the Sunday incident, web sleuths turned up a series of images they believe show the Clinton campaign used a ”body double” to reassure the public and trick the press. Collected under the hashtag, #HillarysBodyDouble, photographs of the candidate before and after she fell ill are being compared, as features like her nose, ears and fingers are plotted    for examination and debate.  ”Shocking claims are coming forward about a body double and who really emerged from (daughter) Chelsea’s apartment [on Sunday],” blared the right wing Madworldnews. com.  The writer goes on to ask: ”Was it (longtime Clinton impersonator) Teresa Barnwell outside Chelsea’s apartment yesterday, hired to salvage Hillary’s campaign as it was imploding after the collapse?” Barnwell responded to the suggestions    spreading across social media    that she had stood in for Clinton with a tweet of her own. ”I’m in Los Angeles today,” she wrote. ”Not in NYC!” Clinton is sick . .. because someone, perhaps a Russian agent, is poisoning her, Dr. Bennet Omalu, the forensic pathologist whose role in highlighting the aftereffects of head trauma on former NFL players was dramatized by Will Smith in a recent film, weighed in with his own theory on Sunday night.  ”I must advice (sic) the Clinton campaign to perform toxicologic analysis of Ms. Clinton’s blood,” he tweeted. ”It is possible she is being poisoned.” Omalu is, on the face of it, a more credible source and discerning eye, but, though a doctor, he has not examined Clinton. Rather than expand on his medical reasoning, he followed up a little less than an hour later with a cryptic tweet: ”I do not trust Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump. With those two all things are possible.” Though Putin’s government has been implicated in the 2006 poisoning death of a former KGB operative in London, there is no evidence    and nothing in any of Clinton’s medical notices, provided by her physician    to suggest anything of the sort is at play here. Clinton has suffers from   ’dysphasia’  The bulk of the most prominent healther conspiracies center on Clinton’s December 2012 concussion, suffered after she fainted while sick with a stomach virus.  Clinton’s injury caused her to postpone planned testimony on the Benghazi attack, leading   skeptics to accuse the   of state of coming down with a ”diplomatic illness”    or faking it. Those whispers died by the end of the month, when doctors discovered a blood clot in the vein behind her right ear during a   exam. Clinton was treated with blood thinners and she testified to Senate and House committees a few weeks later, on January 23, 2013. Multiple currently circulating theories attach themselves to the 2012 fall, including one pushed by Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson, who in August offered    that Clinton was suffering from dysphasia, a neurological disorder that complicates speech and language comprehension due to brain trauma or disease. ”What’s new are the other reports of the observations of Hillary Clinton’s behavior and mannerisms,” Pierson said during an appearance on MSNBC, after being asked why the campaign was indulging the rumors. ”Specifically with what you just showed in those previous clips, as well as her dysphasia, the fact that she’s fallen, she has had a concussion.” Meanwhile, a Fox News contributor Dr. Marc Siegel    who himself has noted that he is ”not a neurologist”    pushed a similar line.  ”I saw the same video you saw, and I’m wondering about a word called ’aphasia,’ where you’re searching for words, you suddenly lose those words, and that can be the sign, again, of some kind of traumatic brain injury or the   of a concussion,” he said on   commentator Sean Hannity’s show.  Brain damage, seizures, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, The list of purported maladies goes on.  Karl Rove, the former top adviser to President George W. Bush, suggested in 2014 Clinton had been ”wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury,” while assorted   sites and Twitter trolls have suggested she is prone to seizures    a belief that sprung a new theory claiming a Secret Service agent’s flashlight was really an ”an   with Diazepam.”  Other have mused that she could be suffering from Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease. The conservative Powerline blog featured an anonymous letter on Sunday, from who it described as a ”prominent internist,” suggesting Clinton’s pneumonia was related to Parkinson’s:  ”I raise this second possibility,” he wrote, ”because of Hillary’s history of neurological illnesses (blood clot in brain, concussion) hints raised on the internet in Wikileaks documents and by others that she may have a neurological disease like Parkinson’s, and her by now well documented history of recurrent coughing fits. This second possibility is that she has an aspiration pneumonia.” The first possibility, stated at the top, was that she simply had contracted the illness, like any other ”healthy person living her usual life.” Others, if you feel like further plumbing the depths of ungrounded theories, include: Lupus, HIV and ”imminent heart failure” event    only months away.",

    "text": "(CNN) This baby’s making waves.  A sailor who hadn’t previously disclosed her pregnancy gave birth recently aboard an aircraft carrier currently involved in military operations against ISIS, the Navy has confirmed.  A Navy spokesman said the sailor had complained of abdominal pains and was checked into the medical department on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. It was there where she later gave birth to a   girl. Both the baby girl and her mother ”are healthy and are doing well,” according to Cmdr. Bill Urban of the US Naval Forces Central Command. ”As the baby was born at sea aboard an operational unit, the main focus for the US Navy, the ship and its crew is the safety and   of the baby and the mother,” Urban said.  The woman and child were flown to Bahrain by helicopter with a medical escort, where they are receiving   care at a   hospital. The unexpected birth came at a tense time aboard the ship. The Eisenhower was in the Persian Gulf in support of   air campaign against the ISIS.  Urban said that Navy policy allows expectant mothers to ”remain onboard a ship up to the 20th week of pregnancy and only if the time for medical evacuation to an emergency treatment facility is less than six hours.” But the Navy was unaware of this particular pregnancy, he added. ”While it would have been preferred to send her to her homeport earlier, per policy, we are now focused on caring for the health and welfare of our sailor and the newest member of our Navy family,” Urban said. ”We are working a plan to move them to a   hospital as soon as possible.”",

    "text": "(CNN) A terminally ill minor has become the first child to be euthanized in Belgium since age restrictions were lifted in the country two years ago, according to several sources.  A Belgian lawmaker told CNN affiliate VTM that the   suicide happened within the past week.  The child, who was suffering from an incurable disease, had asked for euthanasia, Sen.   De Gucht told VTM. The identity of the child and age are unknown. ”I think it’s very important that we, as a society, have given the opportunity to those people to decide for themselves in what manner they cope with that situation,” said Gucht, a supporter of euthanasia legislation. RELATED: Parents plead to be able to help terminally ill children die, Wim Distelmans, who chairs Belgium’s Federal Control and Evaluation Committee on Euthanasia, told state broadcaster RTBF that fortunately few children had demanded mercy killing but ”that does not mean we should deny them the right to a dignified death.” Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002 for those in ”constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated.” Minors were included in the original proposals but removed from the final legislation in the face of political opposition. In 2014, the bill extended the ”right to die” to those under the age of 18. But there were additional strict conditions, including that the child was judged to be able to understand what euthanasia means.  Consent of parents or guardians must also be given. ”This can only be in cases of serious and incurable diseases, which is the same thing for adults . .. but for minors an additional condition is that the death must be expected in the near future,” Jacqueline Herremans told RTBF. Herremans is the president of Belgium’s Association for the Right to Die with Dignity and also a member of the federal committee on euthanasia.  Belgium is the only country that allows euthanasia for children of any age.  The Netherlands also allows mercy killings for children, but only for those 12 and over. It became the first country to legalize euthanasia in April 2002.    suicide is legal in five US states. Individuals have the option under state law in Oregon, Vermont, Washington and California. In Montana, it is an option given to individuals via court decision. They must have a terminal illness as well as a prognosis of six months or less to live. Physicians cannot be prosecuted for prescribing medications to hasten death.",

A double bogey on the ninth was the only blemish on Chun’s otherwise perfect scorecard Saturday, and the    now has her eye on the   lowest score recorded at a women’s major. She is chasing the    total shot by Karen Stupples at the 2004 British Open, which was matched by Inbee Park at the PGA Championship in 2015. ”It’s a really big honor for me,” Chun said of equaling the feat. ”But I just have to stick with my game plan. ”The game plan for tomorrow is just to keep doing the same thing.  ”I’m not going to think about winning.

We are good friends.” This is Chun’s first year on LPGA Tour and she is aiming to become only the second woman in history to win her first two LPGA titles at major championships, following in the footsteps of compatriot Se Ri Pak. Chun’s first major victory came in last year’s US Open, although she failed to make the cut in the defense of her title in July. Chinese golfer, and bronze medalist from Rio 2016, Shanshan Feng was a further two shots back and alone in third place.

    "text": "Washington (CNN) Indications are growing that the attack to retake Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city and ISIS’ last major stronghold in the country, could begin as soon as next month. Hundreds of US troops have arrived at an air base 40 miles south of Mosul to support Iraq’s efforts to liberate that city, a US defense official told CNN.  The   coalition to counter ISIS says it carried out four additional airstrikes near Mosul and Qayyarah Friday, destroying eight ISIS fighting positions and damaging a tunnel entrance. Near Qayyarah, two strikes engaged an ISIS tactical unit and destroyed a vehicle, a weapons cache and 29 watercraft. Qayyarah air base was recaptured from ISIS by Iraqi soldiers backed by US airstrikes in July and the American forces operating there will mainly provide logistics, supplies and support for the Iraqi offensive on Mosul. The move brings US personnel closer to the battle and ISIS’ defensive lines.  ”When the (Iraqi Security Force) is ready to move on in their operations to get after Mosul, we’ll be prepared to support that and the airfield will be ready,” Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian told reporters Tuesday at the Pentagon. He added that coalition forces are conducting intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance efforts in the area. Asked if US forces advising the Mosul operation faced increased risk, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook told reporters Thursday that ”the secretary (of defense) has made clear that our forces in Iraq are in harm’s way. Everyone who is serving there is in a dangerous situation.” The air base is also expected to be rebuilt to allow US and coalition aircraft to operate there, since its proximity to Mosul makes it tactically important.  ”This is a partnered effort. This is something we’re working from both the land component perspective with the Iraqis and clearly ensuring that, as we begin to put some of our airplanes in there in the future, that it’s got the capabilities that we need,” Harrigian added, describing efforts to prepare Qayyarah.  The assault could begin as early as October, according to several US officials. The next stage of the effort to retake Mosul will involve attempts to seize towns and villages on the southern outskirts of the city. Iraqi security forces air dropped thousands of leaflets south of the city over the weekend warning citizens in anticipation of a new offensive.  ”Protect yourself, don’t be human shields for the enemy, leave the town immediately,” a leaflet shown by the Iraqi military to CNN said.  The coalition is stepping up airstrikes along key infiltration routes into Mosul in hopes of keeping the city from being reinforced further by ISIS, a US defense official added. The coalition announced Friday that it had carried out airstrikes Thursday against a logistics facility in Mosul and an ISIS tactical unit in Qayyarah. The fight for Mosul is expected to be a difficult one. Defense officials and intelligence analysts said ISIS has   since it first seized the city in 2014. There are 3, 000 to 4, 500 ISIS fighters in Mosul, according to Operation Inherent Resolve spokesman Col. John Dorrian. ”There is still a tough fight ahead against an adaptive enemy that will try to challenge us as we hone in on Mosul,” said Harrigian, the commander of US air forces in the Middle East.",

    "text": "(CNN) A beloved high school teacher whose students gathered outside his window to serenade him has died after a battle with cancer.  Ben Ellis, who taught Latin and Bible studies at Christ Presbyterian Academy in Nashville, died Friday, said Nate Morrow, the school’s headmaster.  A few days ago, 400 students from the school showed up outside his home to sing songs of worship when he could no longer teach. Despite chemotherapy and radiation treatments, Ellis taught until earlier this month because the distraction  helped him through it.  Surprise serenade, Last week, he was having a tough morning after receiving bad news about his treatment options, according to Morrow.  ”The high school principal said, ’Ben has loved us well. Stop what you’re doing, load up the buses. We’re going to his house to worship with him,’” Morrow said.  In a video posted by musician Tim McGraw, the teacher is seen singing along to ”Holy Spirit You are Welcome Here” with the students gathered outside his window.  ”A friend sent this to me today,” McGraw wrote. ”The entire student body (400+ students plus HS faculty) drove to his house to worship with him.” ’Full of hope, peace’ The video has been viewed 31 million times since it was posted, and Ellis’ friends and family have been posting their stories in the comments. ”Ben is my son,” Bob Ellis wrote. ”Through his ministry and teaching, he has positively touched countless hundreds of lives directly and many thousands indirectly. He, his wife and children are a beautiful family.” Morrow said his death affected them all.  ”He left these words for us, spoken over the students at his house, and I share them with you to guide us now,” Morrow said. ”He said, ’I love you. I believe now more than ever that God is good, and that He is with us. I am full of hope, peace and joy. I wish all this for you. Look to Jesus to know, to believe, and to be filled. ’” Ellis leaves behind a wife and five children.",

    "text": "(CNN) Frustrated with the University of North Carolina’s handling of sexual violence reports, five women took matters into their own hands by going public with their stories and pursuing justice through other means. Sound familiar? Maybe to those following the story of Delaney Robinson this week. The UNC Chapel Hill sophomore went public with allegations that the school failed to conduct a thorough investigation when she accused a football player of raping her on Valentine’s Day.   Because the case has yet to be resolved through the school’s investigative process, Robinson turned to the criminal justice system. She reported the allegations to an Orange County magistrate in an effort to bring charges against the athlete, Allen Artis. Artis faces misdemeanor charges, and a criminal investigation continues to determine if felony charges are merited.  Like many schools across the country, UNC at Chapel Hill is grappling with how to effectively deal with sexual misconduct on campus. What’s troubling to some alumni and advocacy groups about this instance is its timing, three years after the women turned their allegations into a civil rights case and two years after the school revised its misconduct policy to address some of the problems Robinson and her attorney now describe. Since the new policy took effect in 2014, the school has experienced a 52%    increase in the number of formal investigations of sexual assault    sign that ”community members feel more comfortable coming forward,” UNC Chancellor Carol Folt said. The problem appears to be enforcement, as Robinson’s case apparently suggests, said former UNC student Andrea Pino. A new policy, The school declined to comment on Robinson’s allegations, citing student privacy laws. In an open letter to the UNC Chapel Hill community, Chancellor Carol Folt cautioned against rushing to conclusions. She stood by university employees and urged the public to have faith in the adjudication process. ”The issues involved in sexual assault are challenging. Inevitably, some will walk away from the process disagreeing with the outcome. That does not reflect in any way on the integrity of our employees or our process,” Folt said. ”We are committed to ensuring every step of our policy and procedures is correctly followed. Sometimes, to get it right takes longer than anticipated. But in the end, a respectful, reliable and equitable investigation must be the result.” The revised policy is among the most thorough in the country, said Pino,   of ”We Believe You: Survivors of Campus Sexual Assault Speak Out.” Pino was one of the five women who went public and filed complaints against UNC in 2013 with the US Department of Education. She also appeared in the CNN documentary about campus sexual assault, ”The Hunting Ground.” Among the most significant changes were expanded definitions of consent and incapacitation, an expanded scope of prohibited behavior, and streamlined reporting options that are easy to find on the school’s website.  The school shifted jurisdiction over the cases from a   panel to a Title IX compliance coordinator in the school’s Equal Opportunity and Compliance Office. UNC added counseling services in the interest of providing care and ensuring the safety of the reporting party and the campus community. ”These individuals and staff within these offices are well trained on how to conduct investigations, document incidents, and respond to reports,” the policy states.  The policy changes were intended ”to add resources to provide compassionate care and accommodations for those who need support with their    logistics,” Folt said in her open letter.  An annual report for the   academic year breaks down outcomes in allegations of interpersonal violence, sex discrimination, sexual Assault, sexual harassment or stalking involving students. Of 18 allegations, 11 resulted in unspecified sanctions, and seven did not. ”To this day I’m not sure if anyone has been expelled for sexual assault,” Pino said. ”As great as your policy is, if it’s not leading to deterrence, then it might as well not be there at all.” ’Suspicion and condemnation’ Like Pino and her   Robinson says the school failed to take her report seriously, subjected her to humiliating questions and treatment, and dragged out the process beyond a reasonable time frame. According to the policy, the goal is to resolve all reports within one academic semester, which includes up to 35 business days for the investigation and 25 days for rendering a decision and finalizing an outcome, if necessary. A case could take longer, depending on its ”complexity,” to ensure its ”integrity and completeness.”  Robinson, who filed a report March 9, is still awaiting a decision. School officials told her the investigation would conclude by April 26, with a conclusion within 90 days of filing. She blames the delays on ”countless errors and missteps” in an ”ineffective investigation” by UNC’s Department of Public Safety from the moment she went to the hospital for a rape kit. A letter from her attorney to the chancellor said the lead investigator inexplicably waited one month to send the kit to the state crime lab for testing despite best practices for evidence handling and against the interest of processing the case in a timely fashion.  Robinson says Department of Public Safety investigators asked questions about what she wore that night, how much she drank and how many men she had slept with before. Her attorney, Denise Branch, said in the letter to the chancellor that investigators proposed alternative hypotheses for why she reported the rape: She regretted the consensual encounter she wanted to claim she had sex with a UNC athlete she was upset he didn’t ask for her number. The treatment ”is in stark contrast to the University’s promise of protection and support,” Branch wrote. Instead, Robinson was treated with ”suspicion and condemnation.” With her accuser, the investigators displayed ”camaraderie,” telling him not to ”sweat it” and to keep playing football. An investigator asked if he’d gotten other girls’ phone numbers that night and told him to ”rock on” when he responded yes, according to audio recordings Branch and Robinson say they reviewed. Such questions appear at odds with the school’s promise of a ”well trained” staff versed in the policy’s definitions of consent, intoxication and sexual conduct, as well how to conduct an investigation. The policy defines consent as an affirmative, conscious and freely made decision, conveying a ”clear willingness” through ”understandable words or actions.” Silence, passivity, lack of resistance or a previous relationship or encounter do not imply consent. A person who is incapacitated by alcohol or drugs cannot consent. No matter the level of intoxication, if a person has not ”affirmatively agreed to engage in sexual contact, there is no consent.”  As for the accused, intoxication ”is never an excuse for or a defense,” and ”it does not diminish one’s responsibility to obtain consent.”  Fed up with waiting, Robinson availed herself of the option under North Carolina law to go before a magistrate and swear to the allegations against Artis, a linebacker for North Carolina’s football team.  Artis was released on bond. Neither he nor his attorney have responded to CNN’s requests for comment.   Awaiting a conclusion, As for Pino and the other women, they turned their grievances into a civil rights case by filing a complaint with the US Department of Education, alleging violations of Title IX, a provision of the Education Act that prohibits   discrimination or violence in schools that receive federal funding. They also filed a Clery Act complaint, alleging that the school failed to disclose crime statistics to the campus community. Like Robinson’s, their case is still pending. And what does Robinson want, exactly? Expulsion, felony charges for Artis?   ”I just want it to be completed,” she said.",

Bezos’ fortune  —   which consists mostly of his   stake in the   Web retailer  —   added more than $6 billion, or 12. 5 percent, in   trades Thursday, bringing his total to nearly $60 billion. That vaults Bezos past Slim  —   who for years had been the richest man in the world  —   and solidifies Bezos’s place as America’s   person, trailing just Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, worth $85. 1 billion and $68. 6 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, the    Amazon chief is now well ahead of the Koch Brothers, each worth $53. 2 billion, according to Bloomberg. Amazon’s stock has nearly doubled in value during the past two years, as the company has dazzled Wall Street with surprisingly strong and robust sales and profits. The   surge left Amazon shares at $680  —   giving the company a market capitalization of $320 billion.   profits surged to a record $513 million on revenue of $29. 1 billion. At Amazon Web Services, the company’s   unit, revenue was up 64 percent. AWS  —   which powers Web sites and mobile apps like Netflix, Airbnb, Spot ify and Instagram  —   accounts for less than a tenth of Amazon’s revenue, but it is racking up more than half its profits. In the   retail business, “Amazon devices are the   products on Amazon,” Bezos said, noting that sales of Fire tablets doubled   . But it’s Amazon gadgets powered by its virtual assistant Alexa  —      —   that have been a sleeper hit, accounting for 41 percent of devices sold at Amazon, according to Slice Intelligence. That’s seven percentage points ahead of   the firm noted.",

    "text": "A dream Thanksgiving vacation in the Big Apple turned into the nightmare before Christmas for a California couple whose Airbnb reservation went bust. Annette van Duren, a    talent agent from LA, and her   Alan Sacks, 73, used Airbnb on Oct. 21 to book a Chelsea apartment for a   stay. They shelled out $2, 081, or $170 per night plus a $45 cleaning fee and a $166 Airbnb service charge. The couple was unaware that on the same day they booked,   or that renting out whole apartments for less than 30 days had been illegal in NYC since 2010. “I don’t know anything about New York City    laws. I live in Los Angeles,” said van Duren. “If it was illegal, why did Airbnb have so many on their site to choose from in the first place? There were hundreds of listings. ” On the day of their Nov. 15 arrival at the    studio on West 22nd Street, Airbnb sent the couple a friendly “Tips for your New York trip” email. It stressed the importance of behaving as if they were staying with friends. “We were looking forward to staying close to our daughter, who just graduated from Bard, and being able to exercise on the High Line and the Hudson Promenade every day,” said van Duren. “We were planning on going to Rockefeller Center to see the ice skaters and the tree. We had been planning the trip since September, and we were very excited. ” When the couple arrived at the   prewar building, luggage in tow, they were immediately confronted by a suspicious resident. “He said, ‘Who are you?’ ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Where are you staying?’ ” recalled Sacks. “I told him we were staying in an Airbnb, apartment 2R, for 10 days. ” “What you’re doing is illegal. If you don’t leave immediately, I’m calling the police,” the resident barked. “I’ll knock on your door all night long and let other tenants know you are here illegally if you don’t leave now. ” “Bang away. I don’t have to get up to go to work,” replied Sacks, best known as the producer of the hit 1970s TV series “Welcome Back, Kotter. ” The couple spent a quiet night in the Chelsea apartment. But the next morning, they received a text from the rattled host “saying I had to leave immediately. He reminded me of an email he said he sent, saying due to recent New York City law changes we had to be discreet,” said van  Duren. “I never got an email like that. If I did, I would have canceled the reservation. ” Airbnb refunded the couple the amount of their transaction and offered to put them up in another Airbnb or find them a hotel, where they would be reimbursed for up to $150 per night. “We chose a hotel. We didn’t want to risk being kicked out of an Airbnb every night,” said van Duren. The cherry on top of their quickly souring cake came when they discovered they were being charged $809 for one night in the Holiday Inn on West 26th Street. “The clerk told me that if a hotel has under five [vacant] rooms, they can charge whatever they want for the first night,” said van Duren. “I was ready to turn around and go right back to California. ” The hotel rate went down to $249 the following night, so the couple stayed. Still, they had to shell out more than $2, 200 for the hotel and still  haven’t received the promised $1, 200 reimbursement from Airbnb. “Our dealings with Airbnb were awful,” said van Duren. “I wouldn’t wish it on anyone in the world. ” Airbnb, which generates $1 billion in annual revenue in New York City, did not return a message seeking comment.",

The casino’s owners are trying to get out from under the deferred compensation costs by keeping the plan’s assets in a bankrupt unit instead of transferring them to a newly created company, the suit claims. The retirees could get left with payouts totaling as little as 10 cents on the dollar of what they are due if the plan’s assets stay in the bankrupt unit, sources told The Post. Caesars “has sought to disclaim liabilities through complex corporate transactions and through complex bankruptcy proceedings,” the complaint says. The workers, who filed the suit last week in Newark federal court, were employees of Hilton’s former casino division, Park Place Entertainment, which was eventually acquired by Caesars. The complaint against the plan’s administrators seeks to clarify their “rights to past and future benefits under the terms of the plans. ” Caesars’   owners, Apollo Global Management and TPG Capital, transferred assets to several newly created companies shortly before putting Caesars’ biggest operating unit into Chapter 11 in January 2015. The bankruptcy is hitting a critical stage with an independent examiner expected next week to release findings of his investigation into whether the transfers were improper.",

    "text": "Led Zeppelin swayed a Los Angeles jury Thursday to the belief that it didn’t lift the opening riff of one of rock’s most iconic songs, ending a legal drama that had been building for decades. The jury, however, was not allowed to hear the original verson of the song allegedly copied, but a rendition, because its copyright extends only to sheet music. But it won’t end the debate over whether the legendary UK band appropriated the “Stairway to Heaven” introduction from a defunct California group. “They’re done here,” Jeff Brown, an   lawyer, said of the   trial that had Zeppelin’s three surviving members  —   Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and John Paul Jones  —   each take the stand.  “But the case is going to play out forever in bars, dorm rooms and whatever record stores are left,” the lawyer said. Brown, who considered the verdict a close call, said it would have been closer had the jury heard a recording of “Taurus”  —   the song by the band Spirit that was allegedly plagiarized. Federal court Judge R. Gary Klausner didn’t allow the recording on grounds the copyright under litigation was only for sheet music. The estate of former Spirit frontman Randy Wolfe, who drowned in 1997, claims Zeppelin lifted a passage from the   instrumental. Zeppelin caught another break when Klausner denied evidence about what court papers call the band’s “  history of lifting composition from blues artists and other songwriters. ” “That was crucial  —   but understandable,” said Tim English, the author of “Sounds Like Teen Spirit: Stolen Melodies,   Riffs and the Secret History of Rock and Roll. ”  “You can’t say at a murder trial the plaintiff’s done the same thing five times before,” added the author, who has also studied instances of plagiarism in Page’s   band The Yardbirds. English gave the band props for “putting up a united front to protect their legacy of creating not just any song but, arguably, the most loved song in rock history. ” Page and Plant issued their own statement, thanking the jury for “putting to rest questions about the origins” of “Stairway. ”",

    "text": "Snapchat has filed to go public. Snap Inc. the parent company of the   messaging app, has filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering, according to a report on Tuesday. The   deal, expected as soon as next March, could value the company between $20 billion and $25 billion, according to Reuters, which first reported on the filing. That’s down from earlier reports that a Snap IPO could value it at more than $25 billion. Snap’s app  —   in addition to sending disappearing photos  —   broadcasts news segments and other “stories” compiled by big media companies. The company told investors it was on track to generate between $250 million and $350 million in ad revenue this year. Snap is reportedly on track to surpass that estimate, versus last year’s revenue of $60 million. It aims to reap $1 billion in revenue in 2017. The company continues to lose money as its    Chief Executive Evan Spiegel invests heavily in growth. Companies with less than $1 billion in revenue can file for confidential IPOs to hide their financials  —   while testing the stock market’s appetite. The process was made possible under the US Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS Act. A spokesman for Snap Inc. declined to comment. This month, Snap staged a publicity stunt when it began selling $130 pairs of   sunglasses, called Spectacles, in vending machines near its headquarters in Venice Beach, Calif.  The glasses are equipped with a camera that connects wirelessly to the user’s smartphone to take and send “snaps”  —   the company’s terms for video and photo messages sent on its app. Snapchat started in 2012 as a free mobile app that did one thing: allow users to send photos that vanish within seconds. It has more than 100 million active users, about 60 percent of whom are ages 13 to 24, making it an attractive way for advertisers to reach millennials. Awash in venture funding, the company raised $1. 81 billion in May, which valued it at about $20 billion, media reports said at the time. But investors worry that Snapchat’s advertising sales, which began last October, are the company’s only significant revenue source. Known for its white ghost logo, Snapchat claims on its Web site: “On any given day, Snapchat reaches 41 percent of all   to    in the United States. ”",

Lee claimed the club is primed to “win big’’ and the championship is a management goal. “We’re contenders, man,’’ Lee  . “They didn’t make the playoffs last year, but we’re looking to change that and win big. The ring is the ultimate goal for everybody on the team. I know it is for me. When they talked to me and told me about the pieces they were adding alongside the players who were already there, I didn’t think anything less than a championship [was the goal]. We’re trying to get the Knicks back into the playoffs and win big. ” Lee, who   confirmed The Post’s report that Joakim Noah was influential in recruiting him to New York. Lee passed on a larger offer of $14 million per season from the lowly Sixers. “This offseason, he’s getting out of breath just being on the phone  —   like he’s running sprints  —   but it’s because he’s talking about the city, talking about the fans, talking about the team and everything we can accomplish together,’’ Lee said. “He’s excited and he was recruiting me pretty much the entire time, telling me that I was the missing piece and whatnot. He kept telling me, ‘Let’s get it done!’ Noah was in my ear a lot. ” Lee, who lives in Orlando, has always been known as loquacious, dating to his year with the Nets. Between new signees Lee, Noah and chatty backup point guard Brandon Jennings, reporters’ notebooks will be filled this season. The new trio officially will sign their contracts Friday, according to an NBA source. The Knicks have missed the playoffs three straight seasons, but the additions of Derrick Rose and company has scouts singing team president Phil Jackson’s praises for taking smart risks. Lee said Rose has “a chip on his shoulder. ’’ “With   I feel like he’s hungry,’’ Lee said. “He’s been criticized a lot in his hometown. He’d been in Chicago his whole career and then he’s hearing things like, ‘He’s not the same player. He’s  .’ The city flipped on him. I will never forget how talented that man is. I think he’s eager and hungry, and he’ll use all of that as fuel. This is his fresh start in a new location. He’s going to come out with a chip on his shoulder. ” Lee said he’s had “butterflies in my stomach’’ ever since his verbal commitment. He’ll share the backcourt with Rose and, because of the powerhouse starting five, will be needed as a prime defender, not as a scorer. “First and foremost, he wants me to bring energy on the defensive end,’’ Lee said of Jackson. “I kind of feel like me and Noah will be similar in that standpoint, bringing that energy. He’ll be a rim protector and I’ll be a perimeter defender, and we just want to cause as much havoc as possible for opponents. Then, on the offensive end, they just want me to be able to spread the floor, knock down open shots, get out in transition and play freely within the offense. ” Lee said the Knicks were the first team he heard from at 12:01 a. m. July 1. The moratorium for signings ended Thursday. “For them to be the first team to call me, it was a good feeling,’’ Lee said. “I mean, it’s Phil Jackson. It’s New York. You’re playing in the mecca. ” Though he played one season in New Jersey, Lee, 30, expects it to be more joyous across the Hudson River at the Garden. “If they’re down 20 points, you may hear some boos in there because the fans are so passionate, but then if someone makes a play or shows that they’re giving maximum effort, the fans will cheer nonstop,’’ Lee said. “That’s exactly what you want. You want the fans to be just as passionate as you. ’’ The    Lee said he always had trouble trying to defend the bigger Carmelo Anthony and “it’s going to be fun” being on his side because Anthony draws  .

    "text": "A new flood of Syrian refugees that some predicted could swell to 75, 000 rushed to the Turkish border Saturday, fleeing advancing armies loyal to Syrian President Bashar   and intense Russian airstrikes pounding the city of Aleppo and nearby towns. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said his country would continue to keep its borders open to those fleeing the fighting, but there was some question about how open the borders actually were. “We need to keep this   policy for them,” Cavusoglu said after meeting with European Union foreign ministers in Amsterdam. “We have received already more than 5, 000 of them. Another 50 to 55, 000 of them are on the way and we cannot leave them there. ” Reports from the rainy border Saturday said Turkey was trying to find space in existing refugee camps as Assad’s forces closed in on rebels in Aleppo, Syria’s   city. But the border crossing at Bab    —   a main crossing point for refugees and humanitarian aid  —   remained shut Saturday for a second day, The AP reported. Reports said tensions among the growing numbers of refugees waiting on the border were rising by the day. On Saturday, groups of young men clashed over access to the small amounts of relief handed out by aid groups. As thousands waited in the rain for their share of scarce tents and food, the atmosphere turned hostile, with outbreaks of arguments and jostling. More violent protests erupted after rumors spread that the Turkish government was planning to move those waiting away from the border point to a camp near the ISIS front lines, just five miles to the east and still inside Syria. More than 1, 000 people are waiting there  —   at the villages of Shemarin and Hawar Kilis  —   hoping to cross illegally under the cover of darkness. A senior government official, Gov. Suleyman Tapsiz of the border province of Kilis, said Turkey had the ability to care for the Syrians inside Syria for the time being, but had made preparations to allow them in, in the event of an “extraordinary crisis. ” Tapsiz said around 35, 000 Syrians had reached the border crossing in the space of 48 hours. “Our doors are not closed, but at the moment there is no need to host such people inside our borders,” he said. Some 2. 5 million refugees from Syria are already in Turkey. More than a million other migrants, largely Syrian, swept into the   European Union last year. Some of those who entered Europe are believed linked to ISIS, and may have traveled with the ringleader of the Paris attacks. Controlling access to Aleppo will prove a powerful bargaining chip for Assad in political negotiations through which the UN hopes to achieve a “road map to peace,” including free and fair elections next year. Talks in Geneva had barely started when they fell apart Wednesday as   forces advanced into the northern suburbs. Opposition representatives left in disgust.",

    "text": "ALBANY  —   The state comptroller has rejected a   contract by the state police to buy a $12. 5 million helicopter that could also be used to ferry Gov. Cuomo, it was reported Tuesday. The police sought to acquire a used Sikorsky   in the first expansion of the   fleet since 2002. But auditors for Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli noted that the 2013 model it wanted to buy was outfitted with a “deluxe VIP interior group” and there was no explanation how it could be modified for law enforcement and rescue missions. “It is unclear how this helicopter could be efficiently used for these other missions,’’ the state comptroller’s office wrote to the State Police. Police officials argued that the copter had a range of 378 miles, allowing it cross the state without refueling, and was the only one that fits its specs at the price. A new model, officials said, would have cost $4 million more. “This helicopter is the first to be purchased by state police in nearly 15 years, will be done so at a significant savings to taxpayers, and be able to fulfill a ‎greater range of missions, as well as have a greater capacity, than the aircraft it is replacing,” State Police spokesman William Duffy said. “We met with the Comptroller’s Office last week and addressed any and all questions. We’re in the process of providing additional documentation and have every reason to believe this ‎purchase will be approved. ” In March, the most recent month available for the governor’s public schedule, Cuomo used a state helicopter for 12 flights.",

    "text": "The son of a Louisiana man whose father was shot and killed at   range by Baton Rouge police asked protesters for “peace” and “no violence, none whatsoever”. Cameron Sterling, the    son of Alton Sterling, whose death at the hands of police was caught on video, spoke about his father and protests.  Alton Sterling was killed by Baton Rouge police on 5 July at a convenience store, where he was said to be selling CDs. Baton Rouge police said in a statement that police were called to the convenience store because Sterling had allegedly threatened another patron with a gun.  The press conference on Wednesday is Cameron’s first since he broke into sobs at a nationally broadcast press conference with his mother, following his father’s death. “I came to talk to everyone about one: the death of my father. And, two: about how I feel about people in general,” said Cameron, whose distinctly young voice was calm and composed in front of the scrum of reporters at the Triple S convenience store. “People, in general, no matter what the race, should come together as one united family. “No more arguments, violence, crimes,” said Cameron. “Yes, you can protest, but I want everyone to protest the right way. Protest in peace  —   no guns, no drugs, no alcohol, no violence. Everyone needs to protest in the right way, with peace. No violence, none whatsoever. ” Earlier on Wednesday, in an interview with CBS News, Cameron said he didn’t believe all police were “bad” and that all police “shouldn’t be punished for other police’s crimes”. “The police in Dallas, Texas, they didn’t deserve that,” said Cameron. Alton Sterling’s death spurred a Department of Justice investigation, protests across the country, and was one of the subjects of a march in Dallas on Thursday when a gunman attacked and killed five police officers there.  His was the first of two police shootings that week, including a shocking video of the shooting of Minnesota man Philandro Castile, the aftermath of which was broadcast live on Facebook by his girlfriend.",

Christie’s said they were sold as separate lots on Wednesday but were all bought by an anonymous private American collector. The £2, 479, 000 sale in London included the bard’s first folio, which is widely considered to be the most important literary publication in the English language. The book, published in 1623, contains 36 plays, 18 of which had not appeared in print before. It fetched £1. 87m, well above its   estimate of between £800, 000 and £1. 2m. Christie’s book expert Margaret Ford said it was “exhilarating” to bring the newly recorded book to the public’s attention on the 400th anniversary of the playwright’s death. It was sold along with later editions published in 1632, 1664 and 1685. Ford said: “We are pleased with the results achieved in the sale especially since all four books were acquired by the same private American collector. The universality and timelessness of Shakespeare’s insight into human nature continues to engage and enthral audiences the world over. “Even four centuries after his death, his plays touch and transform lives and continue to be read and performed from Albania to Zambia. ”",

    "text": "Japan has lifted all tsunami warnings issued after a 7.  earthquake hit off the country’s east coast, as the risk of major damage appeared to pass. The quake, which struck east of Fukushima prefecture at about 6am on Tuesday, prompted urgent warnings for people to leave   areas in Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures as a series of tsunami waves hit the shore. The warnings allowed for the possibility of waves of up to 3m (10 feet) along the country’s   Pacific coast, but the highest recorded wave, of 1. 4m (4. 6 feet) was observed at Sendai port shortly after 8am. The tsunami warnings in Fukushima and Miyagi were downgraded to the less severe status of advisories nearly four hours after the initial quake, although people were still urged to stay away from coastal areas. Similar tsunami advisories also remained in place in Iwate and Ibaraki prefectures, until all advisories were finally lifted nearly seven hours after the earthquake. There were no reports of severe injuries from the quake, which struck at a depth of 30 km (18. 6 miles) according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. In a statement, the agency said the earthquake was thought to be an aftershock of the 9.  event that devastated the same region in 2011. The region was also hit by a series of weaker quakes throughout Tuesday. The Tokyo Electric Power Company said it had restored a cooling system at the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant that briefly stopped after the quake, national broadcaster NHK reported. The car maker Nissan suspended work at its Fukushima factory, which was badly damaged by the 2011 disaster known as the Great East Japan Earthquake. A spokesman for the company told the Guardian all employees had been evacuated from the plant, which is in the city of Iwaki, and the factory was unlikely to return to operation on Tuesday. Meanwhile, firefighting officials in Iwaki in Fukushima said a fire broke out at a petrochemical complex and was later extinguished, NHK said. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who is overseas for meetings, said the government would work with local governments to help any affected areas. “From my side, to the nation, we asked that proper and accurate information over the tsunami and the evacuation should be issued, and also to grasp and understand the condition of the damage as quickly as possible, and also to take proper emergency measures,” he said. Twelve people have suffered injuries, NHK reported, including an elderly woman in Fukushima prefecture who was said to have been hurt when a cupboard toppled over. The quake also shook other parts of Japan, including Tokyo. Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world’s most seismically active areas. Japan accounts for about 20% of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater. The devastating 11 March 2011 quake was magnitude 9, the strongest quake in Japan on record. The massive tsunami it triggered caused world’s worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl. All nuclear plants on the coast threatened by the tsunami remain closed in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.  Only two reactors are operating in Japan, both in the   of the country.  Even when in shutdown nuclear plants need cooling systems operating to keep spent fuel cool.

    "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan  —   When the Pakistan army announced that it was launching a nationwide military operation to “indiscriminately” eliminate the threat of terrorism from the land, the adverb had a precise and politically loaded meaning. For the first time, after years of appeasing certain Islamist militant groups for political and religious reasons, the government has reluctantly agreed to allow the armed forces to enter Punjab province, authorized with special powers to hunt down, arrest and shoot suspected militants. Punjab is the political stronghold of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim  . It is also the home of a variety of Islamist groups, including mainstream religious parties, sectarian movements officially banned for their violent methods, and   militants who have been accused of a 2008 terrorist siege in Mumbai.  None of these groups appear to have been directly involved in a   spate of suicide bombings that shocked the nation last week, including one at a Sufi shrine full of devotees that killed 86 people. The attacks were mostly claimed by an   militia linked to the Islamic State, which declared it was starting a war against the Pakistani government.  But the hodgepodge of Islamist movements based in Punjab, although attractive to many conservative Muslims and in some cases used as proxies in Pakistan’s rivalry with   India, are increasingly seen as part of a larger, collaborative threat by Islamist extremists to Pakistan’s stability, global stature and democratic way of life. “In Punjab, particularly in southern Punjab, there are sanctuaries of   militants which have not been targeted before,” said Amjad Shoaib, a retired army general and defense analyst. “This time they will be taken to task, and that will help a lot in eliminating terrorism not only from Punjab but other parts of country. ” After the recent attacks, which rocked the nation and embarrassed its new army chief, the military embarked on a series of raids and arrests last weekend. Swooping into suspected militant hideouts and supportive communities, from Karachi in the south to border tribal areas in the north, the military claimed to have killed more than 100 terrorism suspects in three days. But they did not touch Punjab. Even though one of the suicide bombs was detonated in a crowded plaza in downtown Lahore, its provincial capital, and police rounded up and arrested numerous suspects, the region remained   to military forces.  The reason was essentially political. All of the extremist groups based in Punjab have served some useful purpose to the Sharif government and its control of the province. Some have delivered votes to the Muslim League, which hopes to see Sharif reelected next year. Some banned Sunni groups, such as    have been tolerated as   but not   and some have deflected pressure by changing their names.     once known as    has helped rally citizens to the national cause of liberating the border region of Kashmir from Indian control. In a rare step to curb the group last month, the Sharif government placed its leader under house  arrest, but it has never tried him on charges from India that he masterminded the 2008 siege of Mumbai. Critics have been protesting this flirtation for years, warning that it could encourage the “Talibanization” of Pakistani society and arguing that despite their different agendas, the extremist groups share common beliefs, can easily form alliances of convenience and can be difficult to put back into a box once they gather strength and support.  And even though the groups that claimed last week’s bombings were based in Afghanistan and were allied with the Islamic State, U. S. officials have expressed concerns about a growing “convergence” among various violent groups that operate in the    region and appeal to the same population of potential recruits.  In an interview published Wednesday by a terrorism study center at the U. S. Military Academy, Gen. John W. Nicholson, commander of U. S. forces in Afghanistan, noted that 20 of the 98 groups the U. S. government has designated as terrorists are located in the region  —   “the highest concentration anywhere in the world. ” Nicholson said that because these groups exist in a common “medium”  —   with large numbers of jobless youths, the presence of criminal activity, and extremist teachings in some religious seminaries  —   “it creates kind of a petri dish within which these different strains of terrorism” can “converge, recruit and morph into more virulent strains. ” Still, it took a week of   bombings, a surge of public criticism and a private meeting between the army chief, Gen.   Qamar Javed Bajwa, and senior officials in Punjab  —   where the top elected official is Sharif’s brother Shabbaz  —   to persuade the government to acquiesce.  Army officials said the new operation, named “Reject Disorder,” would include sending 2, 000 army rangers into Punjab for the next 60 to 90 days. Unlike previous army operations in other parts of Pakistan that have chiefly used force to flush out or kill militants, officials said, this one will be based mostly on intelligence gathering. Its mission will also include “deweaponizing” extremist groups, which could entail confrontations at heavily armed compounds.  Some analysts said there are ambiguous signs of how much leeway the troops will be given by provincial leaders, who were forced by circumstances to go along with the military’s plan but have insisted that the rangers’ role will be limited. The specialized forces stirred controversy when sent to restore order in the violent and   city of Karachi.  Among the public, although some critics have expressed concern about the risk of extrajudicial killings and other abuses, the army’s announcement has been met with swift and widespread approval.  “We wholeheartedly support” the decision, wrote the editors of the Express Tribune news outlet Thursday. The rangers, they urged, should resist political pressure and come down hard on the “snakepits of south Punjab” that function as “  support” for other militant groups and as planning and logistics hubs for terrorist operations across the country. The editors added that they “look forward to reporting the excision of the cancer. ”   Read more   Pakistan shells border with Afghanistan as tensions rise over terrorist attacks   A wave of terrorist bombings tests Pakistani resolve   Blast claimed by Islamic State at famed Sufi shrine in Pakistan kills at least 73",

    "text": "Alan Colmes, a   television and radio broadcaster who, as   with conservative Sean Hannity of “Hannity & Colmes,” became best known as the liberal in the “lion’s den” of Fox News, died at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 66.  His wife, Jocelyn Elise Crowley, said that he died late Feb. 22 or early Feb. 23 and that the cause was lymphoma.  Mr. Colmes joined the Fox News Channel on its founding in 1996, debuting with Hannity the evening the channel first went on air. “Hannity & Colmes” became the channel’s     program  —   second only in the cable ratings to Fox News host Bill O’Reilly’s “The O’Reilly Factor” and outranking CNN’s “Larry King Live”  —   before Mr. Colmes left the show in 2008.  Facing off against Mr. Colmes, Hannity projected a style that invited comparisons to that of a bulldog. By contrast, Mr. Colmes, a onetime   comic, was more peaceable  —   although no less convinced of his argument.  On his departure from “Hannity & Colmes,” he quipped that he was “proud that both Sean and I remained unharmed after sitting side by side, night after night for so many years. ”     Reflecting on the odd couple they made, Robert Thompson, a Syracuse University scholar of television and popular culture, mused that “we’ve had perfect pairings of people who often don’t agree with each other  —   Siskel and Ebert come to mind. It always depended on bringing balance to that chemical equation.  “ ‘Hannity & Colmes’ was not one of those balances,” Thompson continued, recalling Hannity’s habit of frothing in the   tradition while Mr. Colmes attempted to proffer calmer arguments. The Fox News viewership “enjoyed the mismatch,” Thompson said  —   the nightly tossing of Mr. Colmes “to the wolves. ”  Mr. Colmes, a   liberal patriot, argued that he was at an inherent disadvantage on television, a venue that often favors oratorical aggression. Those who kept count noted that he often spoke fewer words per installment than Hannity. “I don’t judge my effectiveness by how many words I say,” Mr. Colmes told The Washington Post in 2003. “I think liberals often see nuances in things. . . . Conservatives tend to see things in black and white. It gives them an air of certainty and conviction that might make them more comfortable to watch. ” Mr. Colmes gamely endured withering criticism from the left, which saw him as the Fox News token liberal. Some critics perceived betrayal in his presence on the channel, founded by Roger Ailes and Rupert Murdoch, to counterbalance what many conservatives view as   bias in other news outlets.  Mr. Colmes’s loudest detractors included Al Franken, the comedian turned Democratic U. S. senator from Minnesota, who skewered Mr. Colmes in his book “Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right” (2003). Franken derided Mr. Colmes as Hannity’s “liberal   punching bag” and “the lone Washington General,” a reference to the perennial losers to the Harlem Globetrotters. “Some liberals have a problem with me simply because I work at Fox and nothing I do short of storming off the set in a rage will get them to respect that I work there,” he told Steve Young, an interviewer for the Huffington Post. “I feel quite lucky to have the platforms I have on both television and radio,” Mr. Colmes continued. “Even if everything its detractors say about Fox were true, the most liberal of liberal attitudes would be that one would get credit for being in the lion’s den. ” After Mr. Colmes left “Hannity & Colmes,” Hannity continued hosting the show as a solo anchor. Mr. Colmes remained on air as host of “The Alan Colmes Show,” his radio program syndicated by Fox News, and as a Fox News commentator. On the radio, the New York Times once noted, Mr. Colmes serenaded the listeners who wished him ill  —   and there was no shortage of them, he readily acknowledged  —   with recordings of tunes such as “Put a Little Love in Your Heart” and“I Can’t Make You Love Me. ”  Alan Samuel Colmes, a grandson of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 24, 1950. His father, an auctioneer, ran jewelry stores with his mother. Mr. Colmes grew up in Lynbrook, N. Y. a Long Island community about five miles from the home town of Hannity, who was 11 years his junior. Mr. Colmes was a 1971 speech graduate of Hofstra University on Long Island, where he began his radio career in high school as a DJ. He ventured into professional talk radio, broadcasting from Long Island, Boston and WNBC in New York, as well as taking occasional TV hosting gigs. Hannity joined Fox at its inception and was slated to host a show akin to CNN’s “Crossfire. ” Privately, the program was dubbed “Hannity & LTBD”  —   “Liberal to Be Determined. ”  “Roger Ailes said to me, ‘You know any good liberals?’ ” Hannity told the Times. “So we started auditioning some. ”  The “liberal to be determined” turned out to be Mr. Colmes, whom Hannity had previously debated on other television programming. Mr. Colmes’s books included “Red, White and Liberal: How Left Is Right & Right Is Wrong” (2003) and “Thank the Liberals* *For Saving America (And Why You Should)” (2012).  Besides his wife of 13 years, who resides in New York City, his survivors include a sister. Mr. Colmes confessed that, unlike Hannity, who sincerely hoped to persuade audiences of the rightness of his view, he saw limits in the power of their parrying.  “I don’t delude myself into thinking I’ll bring anyone around to my way of thinking, especially Sean Hannity,” Mr. Colmes told the Newark   in 2003. “The point of a show like this is to provide debate points, fodder and an entertaining exchange. ” He remarked that he enjoyed “having the other side around, if only to prove how right liberals are. ” “We’ll keep a couple of you libs around,” Hannity retorted in the same interview. “You’re fun. ”  Adam Bernstein contributed to this report.

    "text": "New satellite images show the Chinese military shoring up its defenses on a disputed island chain in the South China Sea, adding what appears to be reinforced launch sites for    missiles on at least three atolls. The existence of the new launch sites was first reported by Reuters on Wednesday, and on Thursday, photos of the nearly completed structures were obtained by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). The images show at least eight structures on three of China’s   atolls in the Spratly Islands: Fiery Cross, Mischief Reef and Subi Reef. A U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said Wednesday that the buildings have retractable roofs, making them suitable launching points for   to      missile systems. According to a photo analysis by CSIS, the buildings are about 66 feet long and 33 feet wide, making them large enough to store China’s   missile system. The   closely resembles Russia’s   a    missile system with a range of approximately 93 miles and an ability to hit targets flying at 88, 000 feet. It is unclear, however, whether the actual   launchers have been deployed to the Spratlys, as one of the benefits of the new launch structures is the ability to conceal them from reconnaissance flights and satellites.    (Photos courtesy of CSIS)  Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang didn’t deny the existence of the launch sites at a Wednesday briefing with reporters. “China has indisputable sovereignty of the South China Sea islands and their adjacent water,” he said. “China will uphold its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. At the same time, we are committed to peacefully resolve relevant disputes through negotiation and consultation with countries directly concerned and are committed to working together with ASEAN countries to maintain peace and stability on the South China Sea. China has the right to deploy necessary defense facilities as appropriate on its own territory. ”    Military vehicles carrying        defense missiles drive past Tiananmen Gate during a 2015 military parade in Beijing. (ChinaFotoPress via Getty Images)  The   on the Spratlys would be a significant improvement to the island chain’s defenses. In December, satellite imagery showed that the Chinese military had built a structure that contained antiaircraft guns and potentially   weapons systems, or CIWS. Often found on U. S. ships and installations, CIWS is a network of weapons that tracks and destroys incoming missiles. Both the CIWS and antiaircraft guns, however, are limited in range compared to the  ’ ability to track and hit targets beyond the horizon. Last year, China deployed   to the Paracel Islands, a cluster of similar   atolls north of the Spratlys and near the coast of Vietnam. In February 2016, an   battery was observed on the Paracels’ Woody Island, but by July the missiles had been withdrawn. Woody Island also reportedly is home to Chinese     cruise missiles.    (Photos courtesy of CSIS)  China has long claimed that the South China Sea’s   waters and its tiny atolls are sovereign Chinese territory, but many of the islands also have been claimed by multiple other countries, including Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines. The U. S. military, in support of its regional allies, has contested Chinese claims in the form of what the Pentagon calls “Freedom of Navigation Operations. ” Over the weekend, the USS Carl Vinson, a   aircraft carrier, began operations in the South China Sea without incident. It is unclear how President Trump will react to China’s continued militarization in the South China Sea.     Simon Denyer in Beijing contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Guns mostly fell silent in Syria and Russian air raids stopped on Saturday, the first day of a cessation of hostilities that the United Nations has described as the best hope for peace in five years of civil war. Under the U. S.  accord accepted by President Bashar  ’s government and many of his foes, fighting should cease so aid can reach civilians and talks can open to end a war that has killed more than 250, 000 people and made 11 million homeless. Russia, which says it intends to continue strikes against areas held by Islamist fighters that are not covered by the truce, said it would suspend all flights over Syria for the first day to ensure no wrong targets were hit by mistake. The truce seemed largely to be holding, though rebels reported what they described as occasional government violations, and one commander warned that unchecked, the breaches could lead to the agreement’s collapse. Jaish   a group affiliated to the Free Syrian Army (FSA) which has backed the truce, said government forces had fired mortars, rockets and machine guns in Hama province and that warplanes had been constantly present in the sky. ”Compared to the previous days it is nothing, but we consider that they broke the truce,” Mohamed Rasheed, head of the group’s media office, told Reuters.  Another   group, Alwiyat Seif al Sham, said two of its fighters had been killed and four more wounded when government tanks shelled them in rural areas west of Damascus. A Syrian military source denied the army was violating the truce agreement. State media described rocket attacks near Damascus and several deadly attacks by Islamic State. But overall the level of violence was far reduced.  ”Let’s pray that this works because frankly this is the best opportunity we can imagine the Syrian people has had for the last five years in order to see something better and hopefully something related to peace,” U. N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said at a midnight news conference in Geneva. ”I think that the feeling that we have today is that the situation is very different but of course every day has to be monitored,” he said. The agreement is the first of its kind to be attempted in four years and, if it holds, would be the most successful truce of the war so far. De Mistura said he intends to restart peace talks on March 7, provided the halt in fighting largely holds. But there are weak spots in a fragile deal which has not been directly signed by the Syrian warring parties and is less binding than a formal ceasefire. Importantly, it does not cover powerful jihadist groups such as Islamic State and the Nusra Front, al Qaeda’s branch in Syria. Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb in Hama province. Nusra has called for redoubled attacks. Moscow and Damascus say they will continue to fight them, and other rebels say they fear this stance may be used to justify attacks against them too. The truce is the culmination of new diplomatic efforts that reflect a battlefield dramatically changed since Russia joined the war in September with air strikes to prop up Assad. Moscow’s intervention effectively destroyed the hope his enemies have maintained for five years    encouraged by Arab and Western states    to topple him by force. REPORTS OF VIOLENCE Like several other rebel figures contacted by Reuters, Fares Bayoush, head of the Fursan   rebel group which fights under the FSA banner, said front lines were far quieter. But he added that violations were taking place and if continued could lead to the ”collapse of the agreement”. In early reports of violence, a Syrian rebel group in the northwest said three of its fighters had been killed while repelling an attack from government ground forces a few hours after the plan came into effect. Syria’s state media said at least six people were killed and several wounded in two suicide bomb attacks east of Hama city, including the car bomb claimed by Islamic State. Three children were killed and 12 wounded in an unspecified Islamic State attack in Joura neighborhood in Deir   province. Fadi Ahmad, spokesman for the FSA First Coastal Division in Latakia province said government helicopters had dropped eight ”barrel bombs” on the area in the early afternoon. Assad’s opponents have long accused the government of using such bombs    oil drums packed with explosives    to cause indiscriminate damage in   areas, which Damascus denies. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said government forces dropped five barrel bombs on the village on Najiya in Idlib province. The village is controlled by several groups including Nusra Front. Nusra Front fighters pulled out of residential areas in several towns they run in Idlib province on Saturday to avoid being blamed by local people for civilian casualties if the areas are bombed by Russia, residents and rebel sources said. The Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said Islamic State fighters had attacked Tel Abyad, a town near the Turkish border, prompting air strikes by the U. S.  coalition to try to drive them back. Russia’s Defence Ministry said it would suspend air strikes in a ”green zone”    defined as those parts of Syria held by groups that have accepted the cessation of hostilities    and make no flights at all on Saturday. ”Given the entry into force of the U. N. Security Council resolution that supports the   agreements on a ceasefire, and to avoid any possible mistakes when carrying out strikes, Russian military planes, including   aviation, are not carrying out any flights over Syrian territory on Feb. 27,” the ministry said. Sergei Rudskoi, a   in the Russian air force, told a news briefing that Moscow had sent the United States a list of 6, 111 fighters who had agreed to the ceasefire deal and 74 populated areas which should not be bombed. ”THERE IS CALM” A rebel fighter said government forces briefly fired artillery at a village in Aleppo province, which he said was under the control of the Levant Front, another FSA group. But he said the frontline was quieter than before. ”There is calm. Yesterday at this time there were fierce battles. It is certainly strange, but the people are almost certain that the regime will breach the truce on the grounds of hitting Nusra. There is the sound of helicopters from the early morning,” he told Reuters earlier on Saturday. Fighting raged across much of western Syria right up until the cessation came into effect but there was calm in many parts of the country shortly after midnight, the Observatory said. ”In Damascus and its countryside . .. for the first time in years, calm prevails,” Observatory director Rami Abdulrahman said. ”In Latakia, calm, and at the Hmeimim air base there is no plane activity,” he said, referring to the Latakia base where Russia’s warplanes operate. After years in which any action by the United Nations Security Council was blocked by Moscow, Russia’s intervention has opened a path for multilateral diplomacy while undermining the   Western demand that Assad leave power. The Security Council unanimously demanded late on Friday that all parties to the conflict comply with terms of the plan. U. N.  peace talks, the first in two years and the first to include delegations from Damascus and the rebels, collapsed earlier this month before they began, with the rebels saying they could not negotiate while they were being bombed. The government, backed by Russian air strikes, has dramatically advanced in recent weeks, moving close to encircling Aleppo, Syria’s biggest city before the war, and threatening to seal the Turkish border that has served as the main lifeline for   areas.

    "text": "A man fatally shot four people believed to be members of his own family then kept police at bay for several hours on Friday before killing himself, but a    girl thought to be the gunman’s daughter escaped the carnage, authorities said. Although details of the slayings inside a rural home near the community of Belfair, about 25 miles (40 km) west of Seattle, remained under investigation, a Mason County Sheriff’s official said the violence appeared to have stemmed from a ”  situation.” ”As far as I know, this is one family, the shooter was the father and the victims were his family,” Chief Deputy Russell Osterhout told Reuters. He said the lone survivor, the    girl, escaped or was released by the gunman before the suspect emerged from the house after hours of negotiations with law enforcement and a police SWAT team and shot himself in front of sheriff’s deputies. It remained unclear when the four people found shot to death inside the home were slain. A neighbor, Jack Pigott, 79, who lives across the road from the crime scene, told Reuters by telephone he heard several bursts of gunfire coming from the wooded property Thursday night, and assumed it was target shooting. Police arrived at the home after the suspect himself called a sheriff’s sergeant on the officer’s work cell phone to say that he ”did something” and asked that authorities be sent to the residence, Osterhout said. It was not explained how the suspect knew the sergeant’s phone number, but sheriff’s Deputy Chief Ryan Spurling said, ”the gunman did have a previous contact with the sergeant.” When law enforcement officers turned up at the home at about 8:30 a. m. (1630 GMT) they could see the man through a window and could see that he was armed, Osterhout said.  The ensuing standoff with authorities who converged on the sprawling property ended with the suspect emerging at noon and taking his own life, apparently with one   gunshot, the chief deputy said, adding that he did not personally witness the suicide. Osterhout said he believed the four victims were all found in one area on the property, away from the gunman.  The sheriff’s office earlier released photos showing law enforcement officers with guns drawn taking cover behind their vehicles, and a row of patrol cars parked along a gravel road in a heavily wooded area. The latest round of deadly U. S. gun violence came a day after a man near Wichita, Kansas, fatally shot three people to death and was slain by police at a Kansas lawnmower factory where he worked. The girl who survived was found on the property after the standoff and though not seriously injured was transported to an area hospital as a precaution, Osterhout said. The neighbor, Pigott, recounted stepping outside his own home between 8:30 and 9 p. m. on Thursday to fetch some firewood off his porch when he heard gunshots   ”four or five rounds and then a pause, and then another four or five rounds and a pause and then a couple more rounds.” In the dark, he said, he ”assumed they were target shooting, which they had a tendency to do once in awhile.”  (Reporting by Eric M. Johnson in Seattle; Editing by Steve Gorman and Lisa Shumaker) CHICAGO A total of 101 people were shot in Chicago over an unusually violent Fourth of July weekend, leaving at least 14 dead, according to police and local media, as the city continues to grapple with gun crime.

    "text": "Gianni Infantino vowed on Friday to lead FIFA out of years of corruption and scandal after the former UEFA general secretary was elected to succeed his Swiss compatriot Sepp Blatter as president of soccer’s world governing body.  ”We will restore the image of FIFA and the respect of FIFA, and everyone in the world will be proud of us,” the    law graduate, who for the last seven years has been the leading administrator for Europe’s governing body, told an extraordinary FIFA Congress in Zurich.  ”I feel a lot of emotion and have not realized yet what has happened today.”  After a first round of voting in which he narrowly beat Asian Football Confederation President Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain, Infantino appeared to gather up almost all the votes that had been cast for the two trailing candidates, Prince Ali and Jerome Champagne. He won 115 of the 207 votes in the second round, giving him a simple majority ensuring a European again holds the top job until 2019 and frustrating the hopes of those looking for a swing to Asia. Infantino owed his candidacy to the fact that Europe’s preferred candidate, his former boss and UEFA president Michel Platini, was banned from soccer last year along with Blatter for ethics violations. ”I thank Michel Platini for everything that he has taught me and given me and the work we have done together,” Infantino said. ”I have strong, dear thoughts for Mr Michel Platini right now.” Only the ninth president in FIFA’s   history, he inherits a very different job from that enjoyed by Blatter, who toured the world for 17 years like a head of state, dispensing development funds to his global support base. Before the election, the Congress had overwhelmingly passed a set of reforms intended to make FIFA more transparent, professional and accountable. That package should mean the new president faces much closer scrutiny than Blatter did    his salary will be published for the first time    and have less influence over the    management of the organization’s business affairs. NEW GOVERNANCE The reforms include term limits for top officials and a clear separation between an elected FIFA Council responsible for broad strategy and a professional general secretariat, akin to a company’s executive board, handling the business side. Infantino’s campaign did not at first glance mark a dramatic change from the naked financial appeals of past elections as he promised member federations more money in his quest for support, and an expansion of the World Cup finals to 40 teams from 32. But unlike most of the other candidates, Infantino can point to the fact that he never served under Blatter in FIFA’s tainted leadership, having worked for UEFA since 2000. Sheikh Salman, the bookmakers’ favorite, had been on FIFA’s executive since 2013, and had had to repeatedly deny allegations from rights groups that he had been involved in or known about the detention and torture of Bahraini players in 2011 at the height of a crackdown on   protests. Following Blatter’s   reign, Infantino’s election maintains Europe’s stranglehold on the running of world soccer, and the continent’s officials were quick to welcome the result. ”It is the first time in a long time that I have felt happy about anything to do with FIFA,” said Executive Committee member Michel D’Hooghe of Belgium. ”(Infantino) is a young, dynamic man who has done a superb job at UEFA.” UEFA executive committee member Karen Espelund of Norway said: ”We needed someone credible, we needed a clean winner, a clean man, and I believe we have that in Gianni.” Blatter too welcomed the appointment but was still trying to take a share of the glory despite a day of speeches from candidates promising to clear up the mess of his watch. ”Gianni Infantino will now have to take over what I started, the last remaining points of the big reform package,” Blatter said. ”The new president cannot   now what he likes and what he doesn’t like, that’s quite a task awaiting him.” COMMERCIAL ACUMEN Much of Infantino’s pitch centred on his commercial acumen; during his seven years as UEFA general secretary, revenue from Europe’s club competitions has grown dramatically, but so has inequality between the rich, powerful elite clubs in Europe’s four big leagues and the rest. Many of the skills now required will, however, be in crisis management. Infantino will hope for at least a brief honeymoon after the firestorm that broke out last May when seven soccer executives due to attend a previous Congress were arrested on suspicion of corruption in a dawn raid on their Zurich hotel. Blatter survived long enough to win   at that Congress, but stepped down four days later as the scandals took their toll. Since then, criminal investigations in the United States and Switzerland have resulted in the indictment of dozens of soccer officials and other entities for corruption, many of them serving or former presidents of national or continental associations. In addition, FIFA has been forced to investigate controversies surrounding the awarding of its showpiece, the World Cup finals, especially the decision to grant the 2018 tournament to Russia and the 2022 finals to Qatar, a small, scorching desert state with little soccer tradition. Swiss authorities are reviewing more than 150 reports of suspicious financial activity linked to those awards, and said on Thursday they had sent more documents including an internal FIFA report to U. S. investigators. Many key sponsorship deals have been put on hold until FIFA can be seen to have cleaned up its act, resulting in a $108 million deficit for 2015, an official said on Thursday. Infantino welcomed that challenge. ”I will work tirelessly to bring football back to FIFA and FIFA back to football, this is what we want to do,” he said in his first news conference as president. ”I am not a candidate of Europe I am a candidate of football and football is universal.”  (Additional reporting by Mike Collett, Brian Homewood and Joshua Franklin; Writing by Kevin   Phillips; Editing by Ralph Boulton) LONDON Rafa Nadal continued his imperious run of form as he swept aside American Donald Young       in the Wimbledon second round on Wednesday.

    "text": "A proposed Canadian government bailout of Bombardier Inc’s ( ) new CSeries jet manufacturing program would reduce the company’s stake in the   aircraft, taking it off the plane maker’s books and boosting results in the   two sources familiar with the matter said. The federal government is considering a deal that would give Canada, the Quebec government and Bombardier each a   stake in the CSeries, which would be carved out as a separate joint venture with its own board, ‎said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential. Currently, Bombardier controls 50. 5 percent of the CSeries and Quebec 49. 5 percent. Federal officials familiar with the situation stress it is too early to say whether a separate CSeries board would be part of a bailout of Bombardier. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said his Liberal Party government would announce a decision before the federal budget on March 22. Such a deal would allow   Bombardier to alter the way it accounts for the CSeries business, which is costing at least $5. 4 billion to develop and launch and which the company doesn’t expect to generate returns for another four years or more.  The proposed structure would have a positive effect on the parent company’s cash flow and earnings per share for the next three to four years, said one of the sources.  The company has forecast 2016 revenue of $16. 5 billion to $17. 5 billion. Those figures bake in anticipated revenue from about 10 CSeries jet deliveries this year, according to one analyst. The loss of revenue because of deconsolidation would be more than offset by a reduction in CSeries costs and its cash burn rate in the parent company’s accounts. Canada is leaning toward matching Quebec’s $1 billion CSeries injection of funds through a deal that could give the federal and provincial governments joint majority control of the   seat jet program. The first of the jets, the smaller version, is entering service in 2016 after years of delays and cost overruns.          New jet programs typically take years to sell and deliver enough planes to break even and recover sunk development costs. CASH DRAIN     The federal government is not expected to invest directly in Bombardier itself, as opposed to the CSeries program, and there is no expected change to the company’s dual class structure that favors the founding   family, both sources said.    Within the government, there are some concerns about the parent company’s shareholding structure, which gives the family a roughly 54 percent voting stake, said a person familiar with Ottawa’s approach. The founding family has pushed back against any changes to the company’s governance, he said. A key member of the family, Bombardier’s previous Chief Executive Pierre Beaudoin, launched three different plane programs at about the same time and the resulting draining of the company’s cash is a major reason for its current problems. The investment model, proposed by Quebec and supported by Bombardier, would give the federal and provincial governments a combined four seats   provided Canada matches the province’s $1 billion investment   on the seven person CSeries board, Reuters reported on Wednesday.      Bombardier itself would only be able to nominate three of the seats, putting the company’s representatives in a minority.     On Thursday, Quebec Transport Minister Jacques Daoust confirmed the Reuters story during an interview on Canada’s RDI television.      “If we had a new player joining us, we could imagine having seven board seats,” Daoust said. “The new partner and us would control the company. This is certainly a scenario that is being explored now, because we couldn’t imagine investing   of the funds and having a minority on the   front. ”     Quebec has argued that the governments’ majority position on the CSeries board should assuage federal concerns over the company’s governance.      The governments would act as shareholders and not participate in the    operations of the plane program, one of the sources said. The deal would also allow Bombardier to buy back the governments’ shares in the CSeries at a later date, as is already the case with the agreement between Bombardier and Quebec.      ”The last thing you want are governments to run the program,” said the second source.    A spokeswoman for Bombardier declined to comment.     Bombardier received a boost in February when the company secured its first order in 16 months. That was for up to 75 CSeries jets to be supplied to Air Canada.     Bombardier has faced fierce competition from   rivals Boeing Co ( ) and Airbus Group SE ( ) which have adapted new engines to their respective   jets. That has helped them compete with the   CSeries.      They have also been able to undercut Bombardier’s pricing by discounting their older Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 models, which are late in their life cycles and can be built at a comparatively lower cost.

    "text": "Dow Chemical Co’s agreement to pay $835 million to settle a   dispute provides evidence that Justice Antonin Scalia’s death is a blow to businesses that have had success recently in challenging class action cases at the U. S. Supreme Court. Dow ( ) in the process of merging with Dupont ( ) on Friday settled the   dispute rather than risk its fate being decided by a shorthanded,   court missing, in Scalia, a reliable vote in support of companies in class action cases. The Dow dispute, in which it was accused of conspiring to artificially inflate polyurethane prices, had been on hold at the high court pending the outcome of another case. Following Scalia’s Feb. 13 death, the court’s conservative wing lacks the five votes needed ”to make dramatic new rules that curtail class actions,” said Paul Bland, executive director of consumer advocacy group Public Justice. Dow said in a statement that Scalia’s death and the raging political fight over naming his successor meant an ”increased likelihood for unfavorable outcomes for business involved in class action suits.” Two important class action cases were argued before the Supreme Court during its current term with Scalia on the bench. Based on November’s oral argument, it appeared Tyson Foods Inc ( ) would lose its challenge to an almost $5. 8 million class action judgment, with or without Scalia’s vote. The court had put off its decision on whether to hear Dow’s case pending its decision in the Tyson Foods case. A   Stores Inc ( ) challenge to another class action lawsuit also was on hold before the high court, awaiting the Tyson ruling.   is seeking to throw out a $187 million class action judgment over its treatment of workers in Pennsylvania. Michael Donovan, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said there have not been any settlement talks prompted by Scalia’s death. The other class action case heard by the Supreme Court this term involved online search company Spokeo Inc. The court appeared closely divided following November’s oral argument, meaning it potentially could be split  . That would hand a victory to the plaintiffs, although such a ruling would not set a national precedent.  CURBING CLASS ACTIONS With Scalia joining the four other conservative justices in the majority, the court in recent years had issued a series of rulings curbing   litigation against businesses. These included significant victories for   in 2011 and Comcast Corp ( ) in 2013. In those two cases, Scalia wrote the majority opinion for the court. The Comcast ruling was  . The   decision was   on one aspect and unanimous on another. Scalia’s absence may influence the court’s decisions on which new cases to hear. Four of the eight remaining justices must agree in order for the court to take up a case. As early as Monday, the court could say whether or not it will hear a case involving Direct Digital LLC that class action lawyers are watching closely. The dispute focuses on what evidence is needed to show that members of a class have suffered an alleged injury. Other class action cases that the Supreme Court must decide whether to hear include another one filed by   that is a successor to the gender discrimination suit that led to the 2011 ruling in the retailer’s favor. Before Scalia’s death, the justices also had agreed to hear an appeal filed by Microsoft Corp( ) which is attempting to throw out a class action lawsuit filed by Xbox 360 owners who contend that the videogame console has a design defect that causes game discs to be gouged. That case has not yet been scheduled for oral argument. The court ruled on Jan. 20 against advertising firm   in another class action case, allowing a lawsuit to proceed. With President Barack Obama poised to nominate a successor but the   Senate insisting that the next president, due to take office in January 2017, fill the vacancy, the high court could remain shorthanded for more than a year. Any nominee picked by Obama or another Democratic president could be expected to be more sympathetic to plaintiffs bringing class action cases against businesses.

    "text": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and reformist partners won a big vote of confidence in elections that could speed up Iran’s emergence from isolation, and a key ally told long dominant hardliners to accept that voters wanted them to step aside. The polls for parliament and a leadership body were seen by analysts as a potential turning point for Iran, where nearly 60 percent of its 80 million population is under 30 and eager to engage with the world following the lifting of most sanctions. While advances by moderates and independents in Friday’s polls were most evident in the capital, the scale of the gains in Tehran suggests a legislature more friendly to the pragmatist Rouhani is now a distinct possibility. Top Rouhani ally Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a shrewd  political fixer and veteran   figure, urged hardliners not to stand in the way.  ”No one is able to resist against the will of the majority of the people and whoever the people don’t want has to step aside,” he said in a message on Twitter, referring to the contest for the   parliament and   Assembly of Experts.  A loosening of control by the   hardliners who currently dominate both bodies could strengthen Rouhani’s hand to open Iran further to foreign trade and investment following last year’s breakthrough nuclear deal. In his first comments since the elections, Iran’s deeply   Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, praised the high turnout but made no direct comment on the results.  However in a statement he appeared to set out the values he would like to see in the newly elected bodies, suggesting they should not be influenced by the West. ”Advancement doesn’t mean getting absorbed by global arrogance” he said, using a term for the United States. A more toughly worded comment came from hardline judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Emoli Larijani, who accused reformists of working with ”American and English media outlets” to block hardliners from winning seats the experts assembly. ”Is this type of coordination with foreigners in order to push out these figures from the Assembly of Experts in the interests of the regime?” he said in a statement. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a powerful hardline paramilitary organization close to Khamenei, issued a statement praising the turnout and implicitly accepting the results, but it too described the  . S. stance it would like to see. ”The election winners will do their best to protect Iran’s dignity, power and independence; resolve the main issues for society and the people; and defeat the global arrogance by their awareness and wisdom,” it said, referring to the United States. A   list of candidates aligned with Rouhani was on course to win all 30 parliamentary seats in Tehran, initial results released on Sunday showed. Top conservative candidate Gholamali Haddad Adel was set to lose his seat, preliminary results showed. ”The people showed their power once again and gave more credibility and strength to their elected government,” Rouhani said, adding he would work with anyone who won election to build a future for the industrialized,   country. Principlists, otherwise known as hardliners, hold 65 percent of the outgoing parliament and the rest is divided between reformists and independents who traditionally support Rouhani. ”It is a very big victory,” said analyst Saeed Leylaz who was an adviser to former reformist President Mohammad Khatami. ”It is very good news for President Rouhani. We will have a very rational parliament, a less factional parliament, a more expert and technocrat parliament.” Tens of millions crowded polling stations on Friday to vote for parliament and the experts assembly, which selects the country’s highest authority, the supreme leader.  Supporters of Rouhani, who promoted the nuclear deal, were pitted against hardliners close to Khamenei, who are wary of detente with Western countries.  ACUMEN Rouhani and Rafsanjani led the race for the experts assembly with most votes counted, and appeared to be sure of winning seats, early results released on Saturday showed. The contest may prove crucial. Because of Khamenei’s health and age, 76, the new assembly members who serve   terms are likely to choose his successor. The next leader could well be among those elected this week. Rafsanjani is among the founders of the Islamic Republic and a former president. Often at the center of Iran’s intricate webs of power, he is famous for his pragmatism and political acumen. In backing such a dealmaker, the reformists hoped that in alliance with moderate conservatives and independents they would be able to block the three main   leaders   Ahmad Jannati, Mohammad Yazdi and Mohammad Taghi     from emerging as Khamenei’s successor. Early results suggested some of that goal was met. Just one prominent hardliner was on course to be elected in the experts assembly race in Tehran    Jannati, in 15th place out of the 16 seats reserved for the capital’s candidates.  The assembly’s current chairman, Mohammad Yazdi, in 17th, and the     in 19th, appeared unlikely to win a seat, according to partial results.   is a fierce critic of reformists and has even advocated violence against its supporters.  INFLUENCE A Reuters tally, based on official results published so far, suggested the   camp and allied independents were leading in the parliamentary vote. Some moderate conservatives, including current speaker Ali Larijani, support Rouhani. Reformists had nearly 25 percent, independents 21 and principlists 36, according to calculations based on final results, excluding Tehran where results remain preliminary. Eighteen percent of candidates will have to go to   in late April because nobody won the required 25 percent of votes cast. Over a dozen of the initial winners were women. Analysts say the large number of independents may be significant as they could cooperate across ideological lines with Rouhani’s government. But whatever the outcome, Iran’s political system places much power in the hands of the conservative Islamic establishment including the Guardian Council, which vets all laws passed by parliament.

S. government demand to unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino attackers has raised awkward questions for the world’s mobile network operators.  Top executives at this week’s global telecom industry gathering in Barcelona admit they are constantly trying to strike a balance between the expectations and demands of their own users, government regulators and national politicians. Apple’s stand    it argues that to unlock the iPhone would violate its free speech rights    has brought questions over these competing forces to the fore, exposing gaps in some telecoms operators’ own approaches. ”It’s very complicated, we don’t have a clear position,” Vodafone ( ) Chief Executive Vittorio Colao said, adding that the   mobile operator is in more than 25 countries and must respect the security laws in each of those and more. ”We have privacy and customer safeguards as our number one value. ..I understand why Apple has a similar concern” he said.  However for others it is more  . ”Do I understand Apple’s position? No, honestly, it’s difficult for us to say that we share it,” Orange CEO Stephane Richard told journalists at the Barcelona event.      Richard, who runs France’s biggest telecom provider said he appreciates Apple’s position on user privacy, but this must be considered alongside the need for security services ”to have the maximum means to catch people who have bad intentions”. Network operators are often subject to wiretapping and other ”lawful interception” demands by governments. FLYING BLIND One factor complicating life for Vodafone’s Colao and his peers is the loss of control over traffic running through their networks as customer data ”goes dark” which means it is encrypted automatically when using their phones or web browsers. While no one has precise figures, industry experts say that soon, if not already, a majority of traffic buzzing around mobile networks will use    encryption.      This often leaves network operators, not to mention law enforcement agencies, blind to what’s being communicated. It also has commercial consequences, with network management experts agreed that managing completely encrypted network traffic is posing new problems for operators already struggling to manage exploding user demand for video and other data. Strong encryption interferes with operators’ dreams of using ”big data” analytics on customer behavior for everything from improved call routing to fraud detection, marketing campaigns based on location or social network connections to developing new products and services, as their networks fill up with unrecognizable, encrypted data. One study of a big Asian operator’s network by Japanese network equipment maker NEC Corp ( ) found that 63 percent of its traffic uses   encryption.  This means network operators have to keep more spare capacity available at times of peak network usage to ensure quality of service. ”Encryption does affect   operational systems,” AT&T Chief Strategy Officer John Donovan said in an interview. Industry experts say there are ways to manage different types of network traffic   video or voice calls need to arrive in   while email, text messages and some audio and video can be delivered with short delays.      Operators can also calculate what kind of traffic transits over their networks without needing to know the content of data packets, several network management firms told Reuters, although keeping the plumbing going is not getting any easier for them.

    "text": "A study of nine pregnant women from the United States who traveled to countries where the Zika virus was circulating shows a    number of fetal infections and brain abnormalities, U. S. health officials said on Friday. Two of the women had miscarriages, two had abortions, two had apparently healthy children, and one child was born with severe microcephaly, the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Doctors are still following the two remaining pregnancies, which so far appear to be progressing without complications, the CDC said.  ”We did not expect to see these brain abnormalities in this small case series of U. S. pregnant travelers,” said Dr. Denise  Jamieson, a birth defects expert serving on CDC’s Zika Virus Response Team. She said it was ”greater than we would have expected.”  Brazil is investigating thousands of cases of babies born with abnormally small heads thought to be linked with Zika, a   virus circulating in Latin America and the Caribbean. In the nine U. S. cases, Zika virus infection during pregnancy was associated with a range of outcomes, including early pregnancy losses, congenital microcephaly, and apparently healthy infants, the CDC said. Microcephaly is a birth defect associated with undersized heads and developmental problems. More information will be available in the future from a new CDC registry for U. S. pregnant women with confirmed Zika virus infection and their infants. An analysis of some cases showed the virus had crossed the placenta and affected the fetuses.  In one, a woman traveled to a   area when she was five weeks pregnant. Antibody testing confirmed a recent  Zika infection. The mother miscarried at eight weeks, and an analysis of the fetus detected Zika virus. ”Our lab identified Zika in the placental tissues. That is suggestive that Zika may have caused the miscarriage,” CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden told reporters on a conference call. But he cautioned that 10 percent to 20 percent of all pregnancies end up in miscarriage, so it was not certain that Zika was to blame. In another case, a woman in her 30s had traveled to a   area when she was about 12 weeks pregnant. Shortly after her return, she developed a fever, eye pain, body aches and a rash. Testing confirmed a recent Zika infection. The woman got a routine ultrasound at about 20 weeks gestation, and doctors noted that the fetus was missing its corpus callosum, tissue that connects both halves of the brain. It also had fluid in the brain and there was evidence the brain had shrunk in size. The Zika virus was detected in the amniotic fluid. The woman chose to abort the fetus. In another case, a woman who had lived in Brazil gave birth to an infant with severe microcephaly. The CDC did not release details on where the baby was born. In January, a CDC spokesman confirmed that a U. S. woman who had lived in Brazil gave birth to a microcephalic baby in Hawaii.  ”It’s more evidence to me that this association is continuing to look stronger and stronger,” said Dr. Richard Beigi, president of The Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, who had seen the reports. ”We want to be cautious because it’s a small group of women, but from what I saw, it is suggestive that the effects look to be more severe in the early part of pregnancy,” said Beigi, an obstetrician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The CDC is also investigating another 10 cases of Zika infection in pregnant travelers. On Jan. 15, the CDC issued an advisory telling pregnant women to consider postponing travel to areas with active transmission of Zika virus.  On the conference call, the CDC said it has developed a diagnostic test that it plans to distribute to U. S. public health laboratories to speed the diagnosis of Zika, which currently takes about a week. It is not yet clear that Zika virus actually causes microcephaly in babies, but experts say the evidence of a link is growing. Brazil has confirmed more than 580 cases of microcephaly, and considers most of them to be related to Zika infections in the mothers. Brazil is investigating an additional 4, 100 suspected cases of microcephaly. The CDC said it has deployed 25 staff to help with the investigation. That was in addition to the 50 CDC staff members in Brazil studying dengue, a related virus.

    "text": "In an unusual move, the two companies sparred publicly about a deal that, if realized, would create one of the largest U. S. companies with almost $100 billion in annual sales.  Major customers also weighed in, with Boeing saying it would careful scrutinize a deal and underscoring the need for ”healthy competition” in its supply chain. United Technologies Corp ( ) said the two companies had talked about a possible combination for years. But it said the regulatory environment had changed and a merger now would either be blocked outright, or any synergies would be far outweighed by regulatory delays, required divestitures, and customer concerns and concessions. ”It would be irresponsible for UTC to move forward with the proposed combination,” the company said in a regulatory filing. United Tech’s filing came hours after Honeywell ( ) spelled out the details of its $90. 7 billion offer to acquire United Tech, putting pressure on the reluctant aerospace supplier to come to the negotiating table. Honeywell Chief Executive Officer David Cote, in a presentation he made to United Tech’s top executives last week and then made public on Friday, said a combined company would have   earnings growth after it slashed costs. United Tech shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average   closed 0. 4 percent lower at $97. 69. That is well below Honeywell’s $108 per share offer, suggesting Wall Street, like United Tech, was skeptical about the combination.  ”Game on. ... There is clear momentum in this saga, and a ratcheting up of the tensions,” wrote Rob Stallard with RBC Capital Markets. He cited concerns about business overlap, and said there were unresolved questions about achievable synergies, management roles, cultural fit, and merger premiums. Jeff Bialos, a law partner with Sutherland Asbill & Brennan and a former senior Pentagon official, said he was not convinced that the regulatory environment was as tough as United Tech said. Divestitures were always possible, but United Tech likely did not want to cede control to Honeywell, he said. United Tech is the parent of Otis elevators, Carrier air conditioners and Pratt & Whitney jet engines, while Honeywell makes thermostats, auto turbochargers and airplane cockpit electronics. Areas of overlap between the companies include small aircraft engines, airplane power units and environmental systems as well as wheels and brakes, CRT Capital analyst Peter Arment said in a note to clients.  Honeywell would likely have to divest many assets and raise its offer before a deal was done, Arment added.  U. S. and European regulatory scrutiny would push the deal’s completion well into 2017, and potentially into 2018, according to sources familiar with the deal. Honeywell said its offer includes $42. 63 in cash and 0. 614 of its shares for each United Tech share. The proposal represents a 22 percent premium to United Tech’s closing price on Feb. 19, the last trading day before the talks were made public. ( ) Honeywell shares closed 1. 1 percent lower at $103. 03. The companies said earlier this week they had held merger talks but did not offer details. United Tech had said a deal would ”face insurmountable regulatory obstacles.” ”It just cannot happen,” United Tech CEO Greg Hayes said on CNBC television this week. ”There’s just no way to get it done.”  A merger could either be blocked outright or made conditional on significant divestitures after a lengthy and disruptive review that would destroy shareholder value, United Tech has said. Honeywell, however, said potential regulatory issues would be ”easily resolved.”  In its presentation, Honeywell said a deal with United Tech would save $3. 5 billion each year by cutting spending on raw materials, consolidating real estate and in other ways. Under the offer, Cote would lead the combined company.  United Tech said the merged firm’s revenues could fall by $5 billion to $10 billion since the change in “control” would force it to reopen contracts with major aircraft makers, said a source close the matter. That would allow those customers to negotiate lower prices, or even find new suppliers, the source said. A merger would create a behemoth responsible for much of the equipment on commercial airliners and many military aircraft, raising concerns for companies like Airbus ( ) and Boeing Co ( ) as well as the Pentagon. The combined company would generate about 28 percent of sales from commercial aerospace customers, and 13 percent from the defense and space sector, according to Honeywell’s presentation.

    "text": "From abandoned astronauts to   Wall Street traders, dogged reporters and frontiersmen bent on revenge, it is a man’s world in the best picture race at Sunday’s Oscars with women again taking supporting roles. The Oscars have not seen a   film win best picture in a decade, since ”Million Dollar Baby” starring Hillary Swank won the top accolade in 2005. The #OscarsSoWhite backlash that took place this year after no actors of color were nominated has overshadowed much of the coverage of Hollywood’s awards season. Yet the   race is indicative of the larger gender gap in Hollywood, observers say. Male stars from Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy to Christian Bale and Matt Damon anchor the frontrunners for best picture this year in Wall Street misdeeds film ”The Big Short,”   revenge tale ”The Revenant,” Boston Globe’s Catholic Church probe ”Spotlight” and space adventure ”The Martian.”  ”Brooklyn” and ”Room,” both   films and whose leads are both nominated for best actress, are included in the pack, but neither film is predicted by awards pundits to win the best picture contest. ”A woman’s film is always harder to get made at a studio,” veteran film producer Lynda Obst told Reuters. ”They (studios) have never been convinced that a female market 100 percent exists.”  That is despite the box office success of big budget films with female leads, including Jennifer Lawrence in ”The Hunger Games” franchise, Shailene Woodley in the ”Divergent” series, Scarlett Johansson’s ”Lucy” and newcomer Daisy Ridley in ”Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”  But studio executives attribute the success of those films to the popularity of the star actress rather than the strength of the female   audience, said Obst, who has produced films such as ”Sleepless in Seattle” and ”Interstellar.”  According to a study published this week, women made up only   of speaking characters in 414 Hollywood movies and TV shows in 2014.  ”Award shows can only be a reflection of the material out there,” said Katherine Phillips, professor of leadership and ethics at Columbia Business School. Much of the problem, Phillips said, lies in movie studios sticking to business models that have worked in the past, leading to ”history repeating itself over and over again.” Films with popular male leads tend to do well on average at the box office, so the formula is replicated.  ”The film industry has been lazy,” Phillips said. ”You have choices to make and there are easier choices, lazier choices and sometimes harder choices to make about diversifying what you’re showing people.”  (Reporting by Piya  ; Editing by Jill Serjeant and Sandra Maler) PARIS Karl Lagerfeld presented Chanel’s haute couture collection under a   version of the Eiffel Tower on Tuesday.

S. growth mutual funds have been among the largest sellers of Apple shares over the past six months or so, fueling speculation that the company’s days of supercharged growth have come to an end. In January, Apple forecast its first revenue drop in 13 years and reported the   increase in iPhone shipments as the critical Chinese market showed signs of weakening. Its shares were flat in afternoon trading on Friday. They are down about 25 percent from highs 10 months ago.  Apple reintroduced a regular cash dividend in 2012 after not paying one since 1995. Last year it paid out $1. 98 per share in cash dividends, or $11. 4 billion overall. Speaking at the company’s annual meeting in Cupertino, California, Cook also said Apple was ”a staunch advocate for our customers’ privacy and personal safety,” as it fights a public battle with the U. S. government over access to the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. Apple filed a legal brief on Thursday asking a federal court in California to throw out an order it issued last week that the company unlock an encrypted iPhone used by Rizwan Farook, arguing such a move would violate its free speech rights, override the will of Congress and jeopardize the security of other Apple devices.  ”These are the right things to do,” said Cook. ”Being hard doesn’t scare us.” Shareholders asked no questions about the company’s stance.

    "text": "U. S. consumer spending rose solidly in January and underlying inflation picked up by the most in four years, keeping Federal Reserve interest rate increases on the table this year. The upbeat data on Friday added to reports on manufacturing and the labor market in suggesting economic growth regained momentum early this year after slowing in the fourth quarter.  The growth outlook was further bolstered by steady consumer sentiment in February despite a recent stock market  . That should help ease fears of a looming recession and probably allow the Fed to hike rates this year. The U. S. central bank raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. ”Growth is rebounding, inflation is picking up and stocks have recovered about half the loss posted this year. Conditions are moving back toward supporting a rate hike,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.      The Commerce Department said consumer spending increased 0. 5 percent, the largest gain in 10 months, as households ramped up purchases of a range of goods and a return to normal winter temperatures boosted demand for heating.  Consumer spending, which accounts for more than   of U. S. economic activity, rose by an upwardly revised 0. 1 percent in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending advancing 0. 3 percent last month after a previously unchanged reading in December. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies on the data, while prices for U. S. Treasury debt fell. U. S. stocks were trading higher. The   in consumer spending stimulated price pressures last month, which will most likely increase Fed officials’ confidence that inflation will move toward the U. S. central bank’s 2 percent target despite low inflation expectations. A price index for consumer spending edged up 0. 1 percent after dipping 0. 1 percent in December. In the 12 months through January, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 1. 3 percent, the largest increase since October 2014, after advancing 0. 7 percent in December.  Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0. 3 percent. That was the largest increase since January 2012 and followed a 0. 1 percent gain in December. The   core PCE price index increased 1. 7 percent in the 12 months through January, the largest rise since July 2014.  The core PCE, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, rose 1. 5 percent in December. Last month’s increase in the core PCE  pushed it past the level that central bank policymakers expected it to be by  .  ”It has to make the Fed more confident in their course of action going forward,” said Omair Sharif, rate sales strategist at SG Americas Securities in New York. ”The bar for rate hikes is relatively low. Unless there are significant further shocks in financial markets, I think we will probably get two or three rate hikes this year.” Financial markets see almost no chance of a rate hike in March and low probabilities of further monetary policy tightening for the rest of the year. SENTIMENT STEADY Separately, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose to 91. 7 in February after slipping to 90. 7 early in the month. It was slightly down from January’s 92. 0 reading. Consumer spending last month was supported by a 0. 5 percent  rise in income as the labor market continued to tighten. That was the largest increase since June and added to a 0. 3 percent rise in December.  Wages and salaries shot up 0. 6 percent in January, as minimum wage increases came into effect in some states, and were up 0. 2 percent in the prior month. Earlier, the Commerce Department said gross domestic product increased at a 1. 0 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter as businesses were less aggressive in their efforts to reduce unwanted inventory. The economy was previously reported to have grown at a 0. 7 percent pace in the fourth quarter and economists had expected that GDP growth would be revised down to a 0. 4 percent rate. The economy expanded at a 2. 0 percent pace in the third quarter and grew 2. 4 percent in 2015.  Businesses accumulated $81. 7 billion worth of inventory in the fourth quarter rather than the $68. 6 billion reported last month. As a result, inventories subtracted only 0. 14 percentage point from GDP growth instead of the previously reported 0. 45 percentage point. The bigger inventory build is bad news for   GDP growth because it means businesses will have little incentive to place new orders, which will continue to hold down production. ”The weaker drag from inventories in the fourth quarter means that any rebound in the first quarter could be slightly more modest than we previously expected,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U. S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.   GDP growth estimates are above a 2. 0 percent rate, but the risks are tilted to the downside amid slowing world economies, a strong dollar and the recent global stock market   that tightened financial market conditions.

S.  goods fell more than expected in May, but orders for capital equipment were a bit stronger than previously reported, suggesting the manufacturing sector remained on a moderate growth path. U.

    "text": "U. S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton crushed rival Bernie Sanders at the South Carolina primary on Saturday, propelling her into next week’s crucial ”Super Tuesday” voting in 11 states on a wave of momentum. The rout of Sanders solidified Clinton’s status as the strong   to capture the party’s nomination for the Nov. 8 election in her quest to become America’s first woman president. With nearly half of the votes counted in South Carolina, Clinton led Sanders by a   margin, dramatically reversing her   loss in the state to President Barack Obama during their bitter 2008 primary battle. The former secretary of state’s victory decisively  established her strength among black voters, a crucial Democratic constituency who make up more than half of the party’s primary electorate in South Carolina. After the win, Clinton appeared to be looking ahead to a   matchup with Republican   Donald Trump, the billionaire whose campaign slogan is ”Make America Great Again” and has called for building a wall on the border with Mexico. “Despite what you hear, we don’t need to make America great again, America has never stopped being great,” she told cheering supporters in Columbia after the win. ”Instead of building walls, we need to be tearing down barriers.” The result was Clinton’s third victory in the first four Democratic contests, and raised more questions about whether Sanders, the democratic socialist U. S. senator from Vermont, will be able to expand his support beyond his base of predominantly white liberals. “Today you sent a message,” Clinton said. “In America, when we stand together, there is no barrier too big to break. ” Sanders admitted defeat early in the night. ”Let me be clear on one thing tonight. This campaign is just beginning. We won a decisive victory in New Hampshire. She won a decisive victory in South Carolina. Now it’s on to Super Tuesday,” Sanders said in a statement.              NATIONAL RACE The Democratic race now becomes a broader national contest. Eleven states, including six in the South with large minority populations where polls show Clinton with big leads, will vote on Super Tuesday and four more over the next weekend. “Tomorrow, this campaign goes national,” Clinton said. Clinton’s camp was hoping a big win in South Carolina, after more narrow victories in Iowa and Nevada and Sanders’ clear win in New Hampshire, will set her up for a big night on Tuesday, when about 875 delegates will be up for grabs, more than   of those needed to win the nomination. Sanders, who has energized the party’s liberal wing and brought young people to the polls with his message of attacking income equality and reining in Wall Street, needs a breakthrough win in a key state in the next few weeks to keep his hopes alive. ”The door is closing fast for Bernie Sanders,” unaligned Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis said. ”Movement candidates are about momentum and excitement, and losses sap that momentum. That’s his problem right now.”      Recognizing his steep odds in South Carolina, Sanders had spent most of the past week in states that will vote in March. As the results rolled in on Saturday, he was scheduled to hold a rally in the ”Super Tuesday” state of Minnesota.

    "text": "A Taliban suicide bomber blew himself up near the Afghan defense ministry in Kabul on Saturday, causing heavy casualties just hours after an attack in the eastern province of Kunar killed 13 people and put prospects for new peace talks in doubt. The attack in Kabul killed 15 people and wounded 33, most of them defense ministry staff leaving their offices, according to ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri. Witnesses at the scene, where a large plume of smoke spiraled into the sky, said they had seen a number of bodies on the ground. The area was sealed off as police and army vehicles surrounded the blast site. ”I wanted to cross the bridge when I heard an explosion,”  said a witness who gave his name as Zulgai. ”I went to the area and saw as many as 30 people killed and wounded. There were damaged cars and shattered windows everywhere,” he said.  The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which the movement’s spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said had killed 23 officers and wounded 29 others. He said there were no civilian casualties. The   attack came as officials from Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and China have been pressing for a resumption of the peace process, interrupted last year, between the   government in Kabul and the Taliban. But it remains unclear whether the Taliban, struggling to contain deep internal divisions, will take part in direct peace talks that the   group hope will be held in Islamabad as early as next week. In a statement issued after the attack in Kunar, President Ashraf Ghani said his government would not conduct peace talks with groups that killed innocent people and said security forces would step up the fight against terrorism. The Taliban, fighting to restore hardline Islamist rule in Afghanistan, has conducted a series of attacks in Kabul and other areas this year and has pressed its military campaign in the southern province of Helmand, where it has forced government troops to pull out of a number of districts. Earlier on Saturday, a suicide bomber killed a local militia commander and at least 12 others outside the governor’s compound in Asadabad, the provincial capital of Kunar, near the border with Pakistan. Provincial Governor Wahidullah Kalimzai said the bomber rode up on a motorcycle to the entrance of the compound and blew himself up, wounding at least 40 people. ”Most of the victims were civilians and children who were either passing by or playing in the park,” he said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the apparent target of the attack, a tribal elder and militia commander named Haji Khan Jan, was among the dead. He had been closely involved in a number of operations against the Taliban in his district last year.

    "text": "Four people were stabbed, and one of them critically wounded on Saturday in a scuffle between members of the Ku Klux Klan and   near a planned KKK rally in Anaheim, California, police said. Thirteen people were arrested following the melee, including one Klan member who is accused of stabbing a   with a flagpole, said Anaheim Police Sergeant Daron Wyatt. Several   were taken into custody after stomping a KKK member on the ground, Wyatt said. Wyatt said the altercation took place as soon as several Klan members arrived at the park about a mile north of Disneyland, for a planned rally there. ”As soon as they got out of their vehicle, immediately they were attacked by   and this caused a melee down the block,” he said.  Wyatt said four people were wounded in the ensuing confrontation. The person most seriously wounded was stabbed with a flagpole that had an American eagle finial at the top and taken to a local hospital in critical condition.  Several witnesses said that a peaceful   had been under way for about three hours when the Klansmen arrived in a black SUV. The vehicle pulled up and three men got out and began to unload signs when the group of about 50   approached them, yelling and throwing sticks, witnesses said. ”Three people were stabbed by the fire hydrant,” said Darren Simpson, 49. ”These Klan guys were fighting for their lives.” The Klan members attempted to get back into the car, but it sped off, leaving them behind, said Dion Garcia, 37.  He said the angry mob chased the Klansmen down the block, yelling: ”Get out of here! You’re not welcome!” ”It was crazy,” Garcia said. ”A lot of us were trying to break it up. This was not necessary, they should’ve just let the Klan protest. This is America, we have free speech.” The Klan, founded after the abolition of slavery in the U. S. South in the   century, has evolved in recent years into a collection of loosely affiliated or independent groups that share a political philosophy based on racial separation.  Most recently it made national headlines when a former KKK leader, David Duke, said he backed Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. Trump rejected Duke’s support and on Friday a man wearing a shirt reading ”KKK endorses Trump,” was ejected from a Trump campaign rally in Oklahoma.

Following these mergers, 3G slashed thousands of jobs. Buffett acknowledged that while he and 3G ”follow different paths” in running businesses, 3G has been ”extraordinarily successful,” and more ventures are possible. ”Jorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners,” Buffett wrote. Clayton has been faulted in articles in the Seattle Times for predatory lending and discrimination against blacks and Latinos, which the large mobile home builder denies. But Buffett called Clayton a careful lender, and said it has escaped major regulatory fines despite 65 state and federal reviews in the last two years. Management delivers ”  performance,” Buffett said. POLITICIANS, CLIMATE CHANGE Buffett praised Berkshire’s earnings power, saying that only a catastrophic cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack on the United States posed a ”clear, present and enduring danger” to the company. Buffett also rejected the dour economic outlooks polluting the presidential campaign. Trump has repeatedly said the U. S. economy is in a ”bubble” that he hopes will pop before he takes office. ”I don’t want to inherit all this stuff,” he has said. Buffett said such concerns are overblown. ”For 240 years it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start,” Buffett said. ”The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.” Buffett urged shareholders to reject a proxy proposal that would require greater disclosures about how climate change might affect Berkshire’s insurance businesses. ”It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet,” Buffett wrote. ”But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.” NOT SELLING IBM  Buffett touted the BNSF railroad and its leaders Matt Rose and Carl Ice, calling their $5. 8 billion of capital spending to improve customer service after a poor 2014 ”money well spent.” Though Buffett did not mention falling oil prices in his letter, Berkshire’s annual report said low oil prices may reduce BNSF’s profit in 2016 as industrial freight volumes decline. The report also noted Buffett’s $2. 6 billion loss as of Dec. 31 in his investment in IBM Corp ( ) but said Berkshire has no intention of selling the stock. Buffett also lauded the work of top insurance executives Ajit Jain and Tad Montross, and called the hiring of Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who each handle $9 billion of investments, ”one of my best moves.” Combs was a driver of Berkshire’s $32 billion purchase last month of industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. As to succession, Buffett noted his advancing age and that of vice chairman Charlie Munger, 92. But Buffett also said he plans to be around on Aug. 30, 2030, his 100th birthday, to announce that Berkshire’s Geico unit has passed State Farm as the biggest U. S. auto insurer. ”Mark your calendar,” he wrote.

    "text": "Investors worried about the risk of a new global recession are hoping that data over the coming week will show that some momentum remains in the world economy, eight years into its slow recovery from the financial crisis. The Group of 20 economies were unable to agree on a joint push for new stimulus measures at a meeting which ended on Saturday, turning attention instead to upcoming business surveys from China, Japan, Europe the United States. Central banks in Europe and Japan may inject a little more stimulus into their economies later in March. But the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England look likely to sit tight for now, meaning hopes for a period of calm in the world’s volatile financial markets lie largely with the indicators. ”It seems economic data will have to bear the burden of stabilizing sentiment,” economists at Barclays said in a note to clients on Friday. A first reading of inflation in February for the euro zone on Monday will help shape expectations of how much further below zero the European Central Bank is likely to push its deposit rate the following week. Euro zone inflation picked up in January but is expected to have fallen back to zero in February, according to a Reuters poll of economists. ECONEZ If there is also a weakening of the monthly purchasing manager indexes for Germany and other leading euro zone countries, the ECB may consider increasing its   program as well as cutting rates on March 10.  ”There is a growing chance that the ECB will do more at its March meeting than simply lowering its deposit rate,” Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank, said.  U. S. payrolls figures on Friday may help ease fears about the world’s biggest economy, which appeared to stumble soon after the Federal Reserve felt confident enough to hike interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade in December. Solid U. S. job growth and pay growth are seen as the best antidote to the upheaval in global financial markets which has hurt confidence and even raised questions about whether the United States was heading back into recession. ECONUS Markets have turned calmer in recent days, helped by    U. S. inflation figures. But the impact of plunging share prices has shaken the confidence of many households and businesses in rich countries. Economists at Citi have cut their forecast for global economic growth this year to 2. 5 percent from 2. 7 percent due to slowing activity in developed economies. They said growth could come in below 2 percent    equivalent to a global recession    because of the chance of weaker growth among emerging economies. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Friday that the global economy risked becoming ”trapped in a low growth, low inflation, low interest rate equilibrium.” Political risks are also on the rise. Businessman Donald Trump could extend his lead as the   to be the Republican contender for the U. S. presidency on Tuesday when voters in 11 U. S. states choose among the candidates. The idea of Trump in the White House is a worrying one for some investors who balk at his populist, unpredictable style. Politics is becoming a factor in Britain, too. With a referendum now set for June 23 on its membership of the European Union, sterling has touched   lows against the U. S. dollar. A decision to leave the EU could hurt growth more in Europe as well as Britain, economists say.  Most opinion polls have shown the two campaigns running neck and neck although one published on Friday gave the ’out’ campaign a four   lead. More polls are likely in the coming days. Economists at SocGen said they saw the possibility of a   Brexit as their top risk for the global economy, topping the chance of a severe economic slowdown in China. ”We would classify a UK exit from the EU as a powerful geopolitical shock, a negative shock,” Italian Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said at the G20 meetings in Shanghai on Saturday, echoing the concerns of other policymakers.   (Editing by Hugh Lawson) WASHINGTON New orders for U. S.  goods fell more than expected in May, but orders for capital equipment were a bit stronger than previously reported, suggesting the manufacturing sector remained on a moderate growth path. U.

    "text": "As Venezuela grows closer to exhausting nearly every means of paying its debt, some oil market participants are seriously pondering the possible implications of an unprecedented event: the default of a major crude producing company.   firm PDVSA faces around $5. 2 billion in payments to bondholders in 2016, much of it in October and November, a sum that some experts say it will be   to meet after the government used nearly all of its available cash reserves to pay $1. 5 billion in maturities last week. A default could curtail some of the OPEC member’s exports by crippling its ability to import crude and fuels used to blend its extra heavy oil, experts and sources say. It could also degrade the quality of domestic gasoline by limiting purchases of necessary components. With the risk growing and payment delays to suppliers already emerging, some firms that sell to PDVSA have begun hedging their bets by using intermediaries or seeking higher prices, fearful they might never get paid, according to sources who deal with the firm. ”A possible PDVSA default is worrying for everybody,” a source from a U. S. oil company that buys from PDVSA told Reuters. And if they scrape together enough funds to pay off bondholders, ”they will not be able to pay suppliers.” The implications of a default for global oil supplies swamped by the biggest glut in decades are difficult to divine, but experts are closely watching the deteriorating finances of exporters for anything that could jolt markets. ”Of course, Venezuela is at the top of the list,” Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of analysis firm IHS, told Reuters last week. Without imports of light crudes and diluents like naphtha that have rose to some 110, 000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2015, PDVSA may be unable to export an estimated 235, 000 bpd of its own heavy blends, according to calculations based on Thomson Reuters trade flows data   a disruption that could help curb an oversupplied global market. Most of the country’s estimated 2 million bpd of exports, a portion of them secured against   loans, would likely still flow as PDVSA’s entire output is not dependent on imports and it has been increasing shipments to political allies. Crude blend supplies to the United States and Asia could also be sustained if PDVSA’s partners, including U. S. Chevron ( ) Russia’s Rosneft ( ) Spain’s Repsol ( ) and China’s CNPC, step in to secure more diluents, as PDVSA has already asked them to do. Yet a default would also likely reduce fuel components imports, which have risen to some 85, 000 bpd due to growing use of cheap   gasoline and falling domestic production. Venezuela was the United States’ third crude supplier last year and Latin America’s   buyer of U. S. fuels. DIGGING OUT OF DEBT While PDVSA’s pending   debt payments of some $3. 3 billion appear beyond its means, a default is far from a certainty, and its president Eulogio Del Pino said this week it is taking all measures to avoid it. Even so, short of a sudden, unexpected recovery in crude prices, asset sales, new loans or refinancing agreements, the odds look long, said Benjamin Ramsey from JP Morgan. While not yet calling for a credit event in Venezuela, a JP Morgan report said PDVSA’s best intentions ”cannot nonetheless trump the cold, hard realities of diminished cash flow.” Refinancing efforts, including a bond swap through its pension fund, are making little visible progress. Expected dividends from its U. S. unit Citgo Petroleum along with money coming from Russian Rosneft’s ( ) stake increase in a joint venture would not be enough to reach October with full pockets, a government source said. Some PDVSA suppliers are already edging away. A prominent trading firm has recently been using local intermediaries in Venezuela to secure payments when supplying PDVSA, as selling directly or providing it with even minimal credit are no longer options, a source said. PDVSA this month failed to award two spot tenders to buy gasoline components because of high price premiums, a reflection, according to one source who participated in the offer, of growing payment risks. To ensure its supply lines remain open, PDVSA has signed deals with India’s Reliance Industries ( ) and Rosneft to exchange crude by fuels. PDVSA’s close ties with CNPC and PetroChina Co ( ) could also guarantee some imports, but those could still be not enough to secure all barrels needed, traders said. LEGAL RESOURCES Even though any legal response to a default would have to pass through an external court to target PDVSA’s assets, clauses included in bond contracts make the company more exposed than the country to any actions taken by creditors to claim owed money, according to lawyers and experts. Amid ongoing arbitration cases, oil giant ExxonMobil ( ) was granted court orders in 2008 that temporarily froze up to $12 billion in PDVSA’s overseas assets and $315 million in a joint bank account in New York. It was done through an extraordinary legal resource called ’Mareva injunction’ that surprised Venezuela. Even though the injunction was later overturned, that case and others that followed have exposed PDVSA’s bank accounts, tankers, cargoes and external terminals and refineries to the legal power of creditors. PDVSA has taken steps recently to protect itself, including moving the accounts that collect money from its exports to China’s CITIC Bank ( ) from Banco Espirito Santo BESN. D. Getting a court order to freeze an account in China would be more difficult than acquiring access to those in the United States. Some PDVSA sales could also be protected if it delivers at its ports under prepayment agreements, so cargoes are owned by the buyer when leaving Venezuela, lawyers said. After selling facilities in Germany, the Caribbean and the United States, PDVSA’s former president, Rafael Ramirez,  recommended the government in 2014 to also get rid of all Citgo’s operations to protect the company against potential efforts to seize assets, according to a document seen by Reuters. But even though the U. S. unit was offered for sale, the attempt was abandoned in 2015 after Venezuela asked it to raise $2. 5 billion in loans and bonds on PDVSA’s behalf.

    "text": "The world’s top economies declared on Saturday that they need to look beyond   interest rates and printing money to shake the global economy out of its torpor, while renewing their focus on structural reform to spark activity. A communique from the Group of 20 (G20) finance ministers and central bankers flagged a series of risks to world growth, including volatile capital flows, a sharp fall in commodity prices and the potential ”shock” of a British exit from the EU. ”The global recovery continues, but it remains uneven and falls short of our ambition for strong, sustainable and balanced growth,” said the communique, issued at the end of a   meeting in Shanghai. ”Monetary policies will continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability . .. but monetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth.” Faltering growth and market turbulence have exacerbated policy frictions between major economies in recent months, and the statement also noted concerns over escalating geopolitical tensions and Europe’s refugee crisis. The reference to ”Brexit” had not been included in earlier versions of the text, according a senior official who had seen various drafts, but was added after British officials pressed for it. Britons will vote in June 23 referendum on whether to remain in the European Union. ”Our view is that it’s in the national security and economic security of the United Kingdom, of Europe and of the United States for the United Kingdom to stay in the European Union,” U. S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said after the meeting. VOLATILITY VS FUNDAMENTALS The G20 ministers agreed to use ”all policy tools  —   monetary, fiscal and structural  —   individually and collectively” to reach the group’s economic goals. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said she sensed renewed urgency among the group’s members for collective action, warning that without it there was a risk that the recovery could derail. But there was no plan for specific coordinated stimulus spending to spark activity, as some investors had been hoping after markets nosedived at the start of 2016. Over the course of the   meeting in Shanghai comments by policymakers made clear the divergence of views on the way forward. Finance chiefs had agreed that ”the magnitude of recent market volatility has not reflected the underlying fundamentals of the global economy” the communique draft said. To pep up the global economy, faster progress on structural reforms ”should bolster potential growth in the medium term and make our economies more innovative, flexible and resilient” it said. ”We are committed to further enhancing the structural reform agenda,” it added. Divisions have emerged among major economies over the reliance on debt to drive growth and the use of negative interest rates by some central banks, such as in Japan. Germany had made it clear it was not keen on new stimulus, with Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble saying on Friday the   growth model had reached its limits. ”It is even causing new problems, raising debt, causing bubbles and excessive risk taking, zombifying the economy,” he said. The G20, which spans major industrialized economies such as the United States and Japan to the emerging giants of China and Brazil and smaller economies such as Indonesia and Turkey, reiterated in the communique a commitment to refrain from targeting exchange rates for competitive purposes, including through devaluations. They pledged to ”consult closely” on foreign exchange markets. CURRENCY CONCERNS Jeroen Dijsselbloem, chairman of euro zone finance ministers, said G20 members had agreed to inform each other in advance about policy decisions that could lead to devaluations of their currencies. G20 host China used the meeting to try to allay concerns about the world’s   economy, and Beijing’s ability to manage it, that have grown since a market rout and a surprise devaluation last August. ”Monetary policy will probably have to be kept appropriately loose, even though people have realized that its role cannot replace fiscal policy,” said China’s Finance Minister Lou Jiwei. Chinese policymakers reiterated pledges not to devalue the yuan   again, and Premier Li Keqiang told the G20 opening session on Friday there was no basis for continued depreciation of the yuan. But there appeared to be concerns that some members may seek a quick fix to domestic woes through a weaker currency. Japan implemented negative interest rates this month to spur growth, and Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he had ”fully gained (their) understanding” from G20 ministers about the BOJ’s thinking with regard to negative rates as a tool for escaping the deflation that has dogged its economy for years. Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said he had urged China to carry out currency reform and map out a   structural reform plan with a time frame. ”Chinese authorities need to present a   structural reform plan with concrete schedule and a package of measures to stabilize yuan, based on recognition that communication between Chinese authorities and markets has caused market volatility and capital outflows,” he told reporters.

    "text": "Thousands of Russians marched through Moscow to honor slain Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov on Saturday, the first anniversary of his death, and to press their demand that the authorities find and punish the person who ordered his killing. The    Nemtsov, an opposition leader and former deputy prime minister, was gunned down near the Kremlin walls late in the evening of Feb. 27, 2015, as he walked home with his girlfriend from a restaurant. Investigators have charged a group of Chechen men with his murder. But Nemtsov’s supporters say the suspects are just   operatives who were paid to kill the prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin. They say the person who ordered the hit has been neither identified nor arrested. ”Nemtsov was killed because he had exposed Putin for what he was in various reports,” one of the marchers, Irina Vorobyova, 60, told Reuters. ”He was a worthy political opponent for Putin but he had insulted him.” Vorobyova, like many on the march, said she thought Ramzan Kadyrov, the   leader of Chechnya, had ordered Nemtsov’s murder to please Putin. Kadyrov denies any involvement, though he has praised one of the suspects as ”a true patriot of Russia”. The authorities locked down central Moscow for Saturday’s event, sealing in the marchers with metal fencing guarded by police, some of whom wore body armor and helmets. Police put the number of attendees at 7, 500 people, but one group of observers put it at 25, 000. Some opposition figures said up to 100, 000 people had turned up. A Reuters reporter saw one man being dragged away into a side street in handcuffs. ”RUSSIA WITHOUT PUTIN” ”Killed for the truth,” read one banner. Another, which showed the   of a sniper’s gun, asked: ”Who is next?” Some carried portraits of Nemtsov and chanted ”Russia will be free” and ”Russia without Putin”. Similar events were staged in other towns across Russia.  Nemtsov had authored an excoriating report on Putin’s rule and, shortly before he was killed, had been working on a report examining the Russian military’s role in Ukraine. Though revered by his supporters as an unpretentious man of the people, some Russians disliked him, associating him with the 1990s, an era of political turmoil and painful reforms, when he served in the government of   Boris Yeltsin. The authorities forbade the marchers from passing the spot where he was killed, on a bridge near the Kremlin. But many went there after the march to lay flowers at an improvised memorial that the authorities have repeatedly tried to destroy.   Russians accuse the Kremlin of waging a campaign to erase Nemtsov’s memory.  The Kremlin has downplayed Nemtsov’s significance, calling his murder a ”provocation”.    Nemtsov’s daughter Zhanna has repeatedly said she wants Chechnya’s Kadyrov to be questioned about her father’s murder. Kadyrov, who calls himself ”Putin’s foot soldier” told   NTV on Saturday: ”Nemtsov did not bother me in real life because he was not on my level.”  (Writing by Andrew Osborn and Polina Devitt; Editing by Gareth Jones) UNITED NATIONS The United States warned on Wednesday that it was ready to use force ”if we must” to stop North Korea’s nuclear missile program but said it prefers global diplomatic action against Pyongyang for its test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).

    "text": "Southeast Asian nations expressed serious concern on Saturday about growing international tension over disputed waters in the South China Sea. China claims most of the sea but Southeast Asian countries Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Vietnam have rival claims. Friction has increased over China’s recent deployment of missiles and fighter jets to the disputed Paracel island chain. ”Ministers remained seriously concerned over recent and ongoing developments,” the   Association of Southeast Asian Countries (ASEAN) said in a statement after a regular meeting of the group’s foreign ministers in Laos. Land reclamation and escalating activity has increased tensions and could undermine peace, security and stability in the region, ASEAN said in the statement. The United States has criticized China’s building of artificial islands and facilities in the sea and has sailed warships close to disputed territory to assert the right to freedom of navigation. On Friday, the United States urged China’s President Xi Jinping to prevent the militarisation of the region. Vietnam, which accused China of violating its sovereignty with the missile deployment, echoed the U. S. call on Saturday. ”We call for   in the South China Sea,”  Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh told reporters after meeting his ASEAN colleagues.  ”We have serious concerns about that,” he said, when asked about China’s increasing military activity in the region. The group agreed to seek a meeting between China and ASEAN’s foreign ministers to discuss the South China Sea and other issues, Cambodian Minister Hor Namhong said. China’s maritime claims are ASEAN’s most contentious issue, as its members struggle to balance mutual support with their growing economic relations with Beijing. China is the biggest trade partner for many ASEAN nations. Neighbours Vietnam and China compete for influence over landlocked Laos, which has no maritime claims but finds itself in the difficult position of dealing with neighbours at odds over the South China Sea. Laos is tasked with finding common ground on the issue as the ASEAN chair in 2016. ”The South China Sea issue is a headache that Laos would really rather not have to deal with,” said one Western diplomat in Vientiane. Thongloun Sisoulith, Laos Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, played down the challenge. ”We are a close friend of Vietnam and China, we try to solve the problems in a friendly way,” he told Reuters on Saturday. ”We are in the middle, but it’s not a problem.” Barack Obama is set to become the first U. S. president to visit the country in September to attend an annual summit hosted by the ASEAN chair.

    "text": "Islamic State militants launched an assault on a   town on Syria’s border with Turkey on Saturday, prompting air strikes by the U. S.  coalition to try to drive them back. The hardline Sunni fighters attacked Tel Abyad, which is controlled by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, and the nearby town of Suluk in the early hours of Saturday, YPG spokesman Redur Xelil and Turkish security sources told Reuters. Coalition war planes carried out 10 air strikes to try to repel the assault, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. It said at least 45 Islamic State militants and 20 Kurdish militia fighters had been killed. In an   statement, the U. S. military said the coalition conducted multiple airstrikes on Saturday near Tal Abyad. The attack was launched hours after a ”cessation of hostilities” came into effect under a U. S.  plan, although the temporary truce does not apply to Islamic State and al Qaeda affiliate the Nusra Front, meaning the Syrian government, Moscow and the coalition reserve the right to strike them. The truce appeared largely to be holding across much of Syria. Xelil said the YPG and Syrian Kurdish internal security forces were able to ”crush this attack and encircle the attackers” although he gave no casualty toll. The YPG captured Tel Abyad from Islamic State last year in an offensive backed by U. S.  air strikes. The town lies north of Raqqa and had been a key supply line for the jihadi capital.  The Turkish security sources said the attack was launched on two fronts and that the sound of gunfire and explosions, audible from the town of Akcakale on the Turkish side, had continued for several hours. Intermittent gunfire could still be heard. The security sources and a witness in Akcakale said war planes thought to be from the U. S.  coalition against Islamic State struck the jihadist positions and that the Turkish army had increased patrols on its side of the border. While not directly addressing the Tel Abyad attack, 14 Turkish   patrolled the   border on Friday, Turkish military said.  Xelil said some of the attackers infiltrated from the Turkish border to the north, reiterating accusations that Turkey was supporting the group. Turkey has consistently denied those accusations and the security sources said recent measures to stop illegal crossings meant it was impossible that the attackers had entered from Turkey. Other attackers infiltrated from the south, Xelil said. He said dozens of Islamic State fighters had been killed.  (Writing by Tom Perry and Nick Tattersall.

    "text": "The United States has set out limits to its use of data collected in bulk about European citizens after a new   pact was agreed this month, according to documents seen by Reuters. A clear explanation of what information could be used for    preventing its ”indiscriminate” and ”arbitrary” use    was a key condition of the new Privacy Shield framework that enables firms to easily transfer personal data to the United States. Under the deal, Washington agreed to create a specific new role within the State Department to deal with complaints and enquiries forwarded by EU data protection agencies. There will also be an alternative dispute resolution mechanism to resolve grievances and a joint annual review of the accord. In a letter to the U. S. Department of Commerce, Robert Litt, General Counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, says data collected in bulk can only be used for six specific purposes, including counterterrorism or cybersecurity. Crucially, U. S. authorities would apply the same safeguards against indiscriminate data collection to information being transmitted through transatlantic cables. That addresses a key European concern that information gathered outside the United States was afforded fewer protections. ”The exception for bulk collection will not swallow the general rule,” Litt writes. Privacy became a sore topic between the EU and the United States after revelations from former U. S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 about mass U. S. government surveillance practices.  That ultimately led to a top EU court invalidating Safe Harbour, the previous framework, last year, leaving thousands of companies in a legal limbo.   CHANGES Both EU and U. S. businesses had lobbied hard to avoid transatlantic data flows being restricted after Safe Harbour was struck down by a top EU court.    transfers are used in many industries for sharing employee information or when consumer data is shared to complete credit card, travel or   transactions. They are also key to web companies that collect personal information about their users and serve them targeted ads, such as Facebook ( ) and Google ( ).  The Privacy Shield will for the first time give Europeans a way to complain about U. S. agents’ access to data transferred under the framework. In another letter seen by Reuters, to EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova, U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry commits to creating an ”Ombudsperson” to deal with such complaints. Under Secretary of State Catherine Novelli will take the role and ensure that where U. S. agents’ access to data has been excessive, a remedy will be applied, the letter says. But in a   change to meet concerns raised by some EU data protection authorities, her remit will cover all forms of data transfers from the EU to the United States, not just those occurring under the Privacy Shield, Kerry’s letter said.  Some privacy regulators had expressed concern that limiting the role’s responsibility to data transferred under the Privacy Shield did not give Europeans adequate means of redress. That is because most companies use a variety of legal channels, such as binding corporate rules and standard contractual clauses between companies, to move data, according to two people familiar with the matter. The U. S. government declined to comment as the documents are not yet public. The executive European Commission will publish the text of the agreement as well as the letters on Monday, a person familiar with the matter said, after which member states will decide whether to approve it.

    "text": "Warren Buffett bemoaned the ”negative drumbeat” on the U. S. economy from presidential candidates in his annual Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholder letter on Saturday, saying they are misleading Americans into believing their children will be worse off than they are. ”It’s an election year, and candidates can’t stop speaking about our country’s problems (which, of course, only they can solve),” Buffett wrote, italicizing ”they” for emphasis. As a result of their dour outlook on the U. S. economy, many Americans now believe that their children will not live as prosperously as they themselves do, the    Buffett said. ”That view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history,” Buffett said. Buffett did not single out any presidential candidates by name. The billionaire in December officially threw his backing behind Hillary Clinton, a Democrat. ”During presidential elections where no incumbent is running, both sides who are running for president always say they are the ones to solve the nation’s problems and point out what those problems are,” said Bill Smead, who invests $2. 1 billion at Smead Capital Management in Seattle. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who won New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s endorsement on Friday, has offered  a bleak assessment of the U.

In his letter, Buffett said ”some commentators bemoan our current 2 percent per year growth” in real gross domestic product, ”and, yes, we would all like to see a higher rate.” But he said America’s population is growing about 0. 8 percent per year, and that 2 percent GDP growth equates to a 1. 2 percent per capita growth rate. ”That may not sound impressive,” Buffett said. ”But in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34. 4 percent in real GDP per capita.” Buffett, whose home in Omaha, Nebraska sits on less than an acre, said society has advanced significantly since he grew up during and after the Great Depression. ”All families in my upper   neighborhood regularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by John D. Rockefeller Sr. at the time of my birth,” he said. ”His unparalleled fortune couldn’t buy what we now take for granted, whether the field is  —   to name just a few  —   transportation, entertainment, communication or medical services. Rockefeller certainly had power and fame; he could not, however, live as well as my neighbors now do.” All told, Buffett said it is not a good idea to listen to these presidential candidates’ negative outlooks.  ”For 240 years it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start,” he said. ”America’s golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs. America’s social security promises will be honored and perhaps made more generous. And, yes, America’s kids will live far better than their parents did.”  (Reporting By Jennifer Ablan and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Nick Zieminski) This article was funded in part by SAP.

    "text": "Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz  released tax returns for several years on Saturday in an effort to pressure billionaire   Donald Trump to follow suit. Rubio, whose financial decisions earlier in his life have come under scrutiny, paid $78, 917 in taxes on $335, 561 in gross income in 2014, along with his wife, Jeanette. Cruz paid $389, 124 in taxes on $1. 2 million income in 2014 along with his wife, Heidi, who is employed by Goldman Sachs and currently on leave from the bank.  Rubio and Cruz, both   U. S. senators, trail Trump in national polls and are fighting to stop the political novice from locking up the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election after big wins in South Carolina and Nevada. The real estate developer has said he will not release his returns until a routine audit has been completed.  ”If Donald is embarrassed about his tax returns, it’s up to the voters to assess the facts. It’s time to stop delaying and come clean with the American people,” Cruz said in a statement. Rubio released his last five years of federal returns on Saturday, while Cruz submitted four years. Rubio said Trump, who has promoted his success as a businessman as one of his key qualifications for the presidency, may not be as wealthy as he suggests. ”I think part of it is he’s not as rich as he says he is,” Rubio said while campaigning in Georgia. Rubio and his wife have only one debt: the mortgage on their house, the campaign said, seeking to emphasize that the senator had moved past previous financial woes. Rubio often refers to the nearly $150, 000 in student loan debt he incurred by the time he graduated from law school, paid off with proceeds made from his 2012 autobiography. He also faced questions for struggling for several months in 2008 to pay the mortgage on his $384, 000 South Florida home, despite a $300, 000 salary from his job at a Miami law firm. Rubio also drew scrutiny for liquidating a retirement account to cover expenses, such as home repairs and school fees. That was reflected in $68, 241 of income as part of his 2014 return. During his 2010 bid for the U. S. Senate, which followed his stint as a Florida state lawmaker from   Rubio had to defend his use of a Republican   American Express credit card for more than $7, 200 personal expenses, which he later paid back.  Trump has accused Rubio of living beyond his means. Rubio’s adjusted gross income in 2010 was $183, 826 in 2010. It spiked to $929, 439 in 2012, when his book ”An American Son: A Memoir” was published. ”There is no doubt the Rubio family has come a long way from the days when their largest monthly expense was a check to (student loan provider) Sallie Mae and checks were sent in the mail to pay bills with the hope the payment did not arrive before the next paycheck was deposited into their account,” Rubio’s campaign said. Cruz’s wealth, with $1. 2 million in combined income with his wife in 2014, placed them well above the $423, 000 threshold of the top 1 percent of earners in Texas, according to a 2015 Economic Policy Institute report.

    "text": "Riding high after a landslide victory in Saturday’s South Carolina primary, Democratic   Hillary Clinton has set sights on a possible   in the Nov. 8 presidential election with Donald Trump, the favorite for the Republican nomination.  ”Despite what you hear, we don’t need to make America great again. America has never stopped being great,” she told supporters in her victory speech in South Carolina, declining to mention Trump by name, but taking a jab at his campaign slogan, ”Make America Great Again.” Clinton said she was not taking anything for granted after crushing Democratic rival Bernie Sanders on Saturday by 48 percentage  points, likely setting herself up for a good ”Super Tuesday” night on March 1, a key date in the nomination battle. But if Clinton and Trump win big on Tuesday as opinion polls suggest, the chance of a general election matchup between them increases, adding another twist to a presidential campaign that has defied convention as U. S. voters vent frustration over economic uncertainty, illegal immigration and national security threats. Some Clinton backers, emboldened by the heightened chance of a Trump nomination, have reaffirmed their support for the former secretary of state, saying that it is she, not Sanders, who is best equipped to take down Trump in a    showdown in November. Rosilyne Scott, 58, of Texas, cast her vote early for Clinton ahead of Texas’s upcoming Tuesday nominating contest, calling the prospect of a Trump presidency ”frightening.” ”I just think she has more support, and she’s been doing it a lot longer,” she said.  ”If you get someone like Donald Trump in, I don’t know. . .. I think he’s a joke, a bigot, a racist.” Amid Clinton’s renewed momentum against Sanders, a U. S. senator from Vermont, donors have also found resolve. One Clinton fundraiser in California said her recent victories in Nevada and South Carolina have prompted more people to donate to her campaign and to attend Clinton events. He said he had raised $10, 000 for the Clinton campaign in the past week alone.  A   election would embody the    battle in American politics. Trump has never been elected to public office, while the former first lady has been a player in Washington for decades.   SANDERS DOUBTS South Carolina was Clinton’s third victory in the first four Democratic contests, raising more questions about whether Sanders, a democratic socialist, will be able to expand his support beyond his base of predominantly white liberals. Exit polls showed Clinton winning big in the state with almost every constituency. She won nine of every 10 black voters, as well as women, men, urban, suburban, rural, very liberal and conservative voters. Sanders was ahead among voters between ages 18 and 29, and among white men. When asked which candidate they thought “can win in November,” an overwhelming 79 percent said Clinton, with only 21 percent putting their faith in Sanders to defeat the eventual Republican nominee. Sanders, who has energized the party’s liberal wing and successfully courted many of the party’s youth, on Sunday acknowledged he had been ”decimated” by Clinton in South Carolina. He set his sights on March 1, where a win in a key state is crucial to keeping his hopes alive. ”I think we’re going to do well on Super Tuesday, we’re going to do well in many states after that and we look forward to those    struggles,” he said in an interview on NBC News’s ”Meet the Press.” But Sanders needs to have his breakout moment sooner rather than later, warned longtime Democratic activist Phil Noble, who said that Sanders’ momentum in South Carolina ”fell off the table” after Clinton’s solid victory in Nevada on Feb. 20.      ”He’s got to pull off a surprise against Clinton soon or he won’t have time to recover,” he said.

    "text": "A gauge of stocks across the globe on Monday posted its fourth straight month of declines, while crude oil notched its first positive month since October. Gold closed February with a gain of more than 10 percent, the most for any month in four years. Stocks rose through most of the U. S. session after China’s central bank resumed its easing cycle by injecting an estimated $100 billion worth of   cash into the economy. But Wall Street sold off into the close and the global stocks gauge finished in the red. Equity markets so far this year have been strongly correlated with crude oil futures, which earlier this month tanked to decade lows. On Monday, however, U. S. stocks reversed the correlation and fell as investors took profits on last equity week’s gains. ”The market’s had a big run, so I don’t think it’s anything drastic, just lightening up after a big pop,” said J. J. Feldman, portfolio manager at Miracle Mile Advisors in Los Angeles. On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average   fell 123. 47 points, or 0. 74 percent, to 16, 516. 5, the S&P 500   lost 15. 82 points, or 0. 81 percent, to 1, 932. 23 and the Nasdaq Composite   dropped 32. 52 points, or 0. 71 percent, to 4, 557. 95. For the month, the Dow rose 0. 3 percent, the S&P 500 lost 0. 4 percent and the Nasdaq lost 1. 2 percent. MSCI’s global stocks index . MIWD00000PUS fell 0. 9 percent for the month, bringing its decline since November to 9. 6 percent. Oil prices jumped after China moved to boost its slowing economy. A drop in crude output from OPEC and the United States, and a pledge by Saudi Arabia to limit market volatility, suggested a   selloff could be hitting a bottom. ”We have to accept the fact that crude is going to work its way higher from here,” said Jeffrey Grossman, energy dealer at New York’s BRG Brokerage. Brent futures LCOc1 settled up 2. 5 percent at $35. 97 a barrel. U. S. crude futures CLc1 settled up 3 percent at $33. 75. Both rose in February for the first month in four.   U. S. Treasury prices rose after weak U. S. housing data supported the view that the Federal Reserve could slow the pace of interest rate hikes this year. Recent U. S. economic reports, including a   in inflation, had shifted the view the Fed could raise interest rates before  . The benchmark   note US10YT=RR was last up   in price to yield 1. 738 percent, down from 1. 764 percent late on Friday. U. S. Treasuries prices showed a second month of gains. The dollar . DXY rose 0. 1 percent against a basket of six major currencies, backed largely by a move down from the euro  . The euro hit $1. 0859, its lowest against the dollar since the start of the month, after consumer prices in Europe fell again. A drop in the flash reading of euro zone inflation to  .2 percent boosted expectations that the European Central Bank will have to ease policy aggressively next month. But the dollar tumbled against the Japanese yen   losing around 1 percent, as investors sought its safety. The yen appreciated nearly 7 percent versus the greenback in February, its best monthly performance against the dollar in more than seven years. Gold, another investor ”safe haven,” rose 1. 3 percent on Monday to close its best month since January 2012.

    "text": "A twin suicide bombing claimed by Islamic State killed 70 people in a Shi’ite district of Baghdad on Sunday in the deadliest attack inside the capital this year, as militants launched an assault on its western outskirts.    Police sources said the suicide bombers were riding motorcycles and blew themselves up in a crowded mobile phone market in Sadr City, wounding more than 100 people in addition to the dead. A Reuters witness saw pools of blood on the ground with slippers, shoes and mobile phones at the site of the blasts, which was sealed off to prevent further attacks. In a statement circulated online, Islamic State said it was responsible for the blasts: ”Our swords will not cease to cut off the heads of the rejectionist polytheists, wherever they are,” it said, using derogatory terms for Shi’ite Muslims. Iraqi forces backed by airstrikes from a U. S.  coalition  have driven Islamic State back in the western Anbar province recently and are preparing for an offensive to retake the northern city of Mosul. But the militants are still able to strike outside territory they control, often targeting members of Iraq’s Shi’ite majority, most recently on Thursday when two Islamic State suicide bombers killed 15 people at a mosque in the capital. Prime Minister Haider   said the attacks were in response to Islamic State’s recent defeats: ”This gang targeted civilians after it lost the initiative and its dregs fled the battlefield before our proud fighters,” he said on his official Facebook page.   At dawn on Sunday, suicide bombers and gunmen attacked Iraqi security forces in Abu Ghraib, seizing positions in a grain silo and a cemetery, and killing at least 17 members of the security forces, officials said.      Security officials blamed Islamic State, and a news agency that supports the group said it had launched a ”wide attack” in Abu Ghraib, 25 km (15 miles) from the center of Baghdad and next to the international airport. Footage circulated online by the Amaq news agency appeared to show Islamic State fighters crouching behind dirt berms and launching the attack with automatic rifles, machine guns and   grenades. Reuters could not verify the video’s authenticity. Security forces had mostly regained control by Sunday evening but officials said there were still clashes.   security analyst Jasim   said the assault suggested it was premature to declare that Islamic State was losing the initiative in Iraq.  ”Government forces must do a better job repelling attacks launched by Daesh. What happened today could be a setback for the security forces,” he said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. COUNTER OFFENSIVE Army and police sources said the militants had attacked from the nearby Islamic   areas of Garma and Falluja, driving Humvees and pickup trucks fixed with machine guns. A curfew was imposed as a regiment of Iraq’s elite   forces was mobilized to retake the silo in Abu Ghraib and prevent the militants approaching the nearby airport, security officials said.      Iraqi army helicopters bombarded Islamic State positions in the and Interior Ministry spokesman Brigadier General Saad Maan said at least 20 militants had been killed in the government’s counter offensive.        Fighters from the Hashid Shaabi, a coalition of mainly   Shi’ite militias, were mobilized to Abu Ghraib to reinforce regular government forces in the area, said Jawad   a local Hashid commander. Powerful Shi’ite cleric Moqtada   also called on fighters loyal to him to be on alert to protect Baghdad. Shi’ite militias like Sadr’s ’Peace Brigades’ were seen as a bulwark against Islamic State’s sweeping advance in 2014 which threatened Iraq’s capital and its most sacred Shi’ite shrines.

    "text": "The Syrian opposition warned on Sunday that attacks by the army, backed by Russian warplanes, threatened a U. S.  deal for a cessation of hostilities with collapse and endangered future peace talks. The agreement, which is in its second day and has drastically curbed violence but not stopped it entirely, is the first of its kind to be attempted in four years. In a letter to U. N.   Ban   the opposition said violations would undermine international efforts to guarantee the continuation of the truce and lead to the collapse of the   political process. [L8N1670O5] The   opposition body said Russian war planes on Sunday staged 26 bombing raids on areas where rebel groups abiding by the truce were operating and accused Moscow of deploying cluster bombs on residential areas it alleged caused many civilian casualties.  A Syrian military source on Saturday denied the army was  violating the truce agreement. Russia’s defence ministry declined to comment. Under the accord accepted by President Bashar  ’s government and many of his foes, fighting should cease so that aid can reach civilians and talks can open to end a war that has killed more than 250, 000 people and made 11 million homeless. The head of the Russian coordination centre in Syria, Sergei Kuralenko, said the plan was holding ”in general” but said there had been nine violations of the truce in the past 24 hours. Insurgents and the   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict, said war planes struck at least six towns and villages in west and north Aleppo and a village in the central Hama province. Warplanes believed to be Russian pounded the town of Teir Maalah, just north of the city of Homs, in the second round of bombing within a few hours of the strategic town that the army has tried to capture in the past to enter rebel held northern countryside of Homs province, insurgents said. [L8N1670NV] Rebels said the attacks across Syria were more intense than Saturday but still not as bad as those before the cessation of hostilities took effect. ”We are awaiting the response of states to these violations, the situation is in the balance now and self restraint will not last long,” colonel Fares al Bayoush told Reuters. The   opposition group had earlier accused Russia of carrying out the strikes and said it would complain to the United Nations and countries backing the peace process but said it remained committed to the truce. ”The decision is to remain quiet, not to do anything, and I believe they will stick to the truce,” said Syria’s opposition spokesman Salim  . ”Yesterday was the first day people can really go out and walk in the streets.” Saudi Foreign Minister Adel   also accused Russia and the Syrian government air force of violating the truce and said Riyadh was discussing the issue with international powers.  Speaking during a joint news conference with visiting Danish Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen in Riyadh, he said there would be a ”plan B” if it became clear that the Syrian government and its allies were not serious about the truce. He gave no details. The deal, which is less binding than a formal ceasefire and was not directly signed by the Syrian warring sides, does not cover action against militants from Islamic State or the Nusra Front, an al Qaeda affiliate which called for an escalation of attacks on Friday.  Moscow and Damascus say they will continue to fight them. Other rebels say they fear this stance may be used to justify attacks against them too. Muslat, who is spokesman for the opposition’s High Negotiating Committee (HNC) said it was waiting for answers about how the cessation of hostilities in Syria was being monitored, particularly since there was no map with a common understanding of the location of various fighting groups. ”This really worries us because we don’t know how to deal with any violations and what are the areas that should not be targeted,” he said. CONFUSION On Saturday, Russia said it would suspend all flights over Syria for one day to ensure no targets covered by the truce were hit by mistake. But insurgents said on Sunday several people were wounded when Russian war planes struck several villages and towns in Aleppo province and Idlib province. The Observatory’s head Rami Abdulrahman said some of the towns which were attacked, including Daret Azza, were controlled by Nusra Front and other Islamist groups. In the city of Jisr al Shuquour, three aerial raids caused civilian casualties.  Other attacks hit the villages and towns of Qabtan   Andan, Hreitan, Kfar Hamra and Ma’aret   the         Observatory said, all in the west of the province where insurgents from the Free Syrian Army have operated. It was not clear if these towns were included in the truce,  Abdulrahman said. Syria’s state news agency accused ”terrorist groups” of shelling rural areas of the coastal Latakia province, causing casualties. It said that the shelling came from hills close to the Turkish border ”where terrorists mostly from Nusra Front deploy”. A Syrian rebel group denied the state media reports. Fadi Ahmad, spokesman for the First Coastal Division, an FSA group operating in the rural Latakia area, said rebel groups were committed to the truce. He said helicopters had dropped six barrel bombs and fired dozens of rockets in the area on Sunday, and the Nusra Front had no presence in the area targeted by government forces. Abdulrahman said a number of civilians were also killed in the air strikes in Aleppo province and other areas. He did not have a figure. Videos sent by a rebel commander to Reuters shows a strike in another town, Harbnafseh, at 6. 30am (0430 GMT) and another at 07:00am (0500 GMT) according to the voice in the video. The footage shows plumes of smoke rising into the sky. Russia’s coordination centre in Syria received from the United States a list of 69 armed opposition groups which agree with the terms of the truce, Interfax news agency reported. Russia had itself received declarations of agreement from 17 armed groups from Syria’s ”moderate opposition” the centre said in a statement.

    "text": "When the U. S. Supreme Court on Wednesday hears a major abortion case for the first time in nearly a decade, the regulations at issue will not involve fetuses or the mother, but rather standards for doctors and facilities where the procedure is performed.  That the high court is taking up a case about such arcane regulations reflects the success of a legal strategy that abortion opponents embraced about a decade ago and initially caught some   advocates off guard. ”It took a while to see the impact” of state laws imposing regulations on abortion providers, said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion policy and supports abortion rights. One of the two Texas regulations before the court requires doctors who provide abortions to have ”admitting privileges” at a local hospital so they can treat patients needing surgery or other critical care. Another regulation being challenged before the Supreme Court forces clinics to have costly,   facilities, mandating a long list of building standards. Unlike the ”admitting privileges” requirement, it has yet to go into effect.  Since the   law was passed in 2013, many Texas clinics have closed. Abortion providers challenging the Texas law say the Supreme Court should declare it unconstitutional. They contend the law was intended to shutter clinics and make it harder for women to end a pregnancy. Texas officials and national abortion opponents counter that the regulations were necessary to protect maternal health. Ten other states also require doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges. Many of those laws are on hold because of litigation. Abortion opponents in Missouri secured passage in 2005 of the first law requiring admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km). The Supreme Court found a constitutional right to end a pregnancy in the landmark 1973 case Roe v. Wade. In the decades immediately afterward, the legal strategy of abortion opponents focused on trying to ban abortion outright or impose mandates on women such as waiting periods or parental or spousal consent. But federal courts struck down the most restrictive of those laws, and the Roe v. Wade ruling was upheld. Responding to those setbacks, some   leaders, such as those at the   National Right to Life Committee, urged state activists to shift to subtler tactics. Key advocates on both sides of the debate point to a 2007 strategy memo by James Bopp, general counsel to the National Right to Life Committee. Addressing what Bopp deemed ”how best to advance the   cause,” the memo urged abortion opponents to stop proposing abortion bans that federal judges were rejecting, and instead push clinic regulations and other ”incremental” efforts that Bopp said ”often shut down clinics.” Another national   group, Americans United for Life, began using the 2005 Missouri law as model legislation for state activists targeting abortion clinics. In 2010 elections, abortion opponents received a boost when Republicans made historic gains in state legislatures and ramped up proposals targeting abortion providers. In 2011 and 2012, Kansas, Arizona, Mississippi and Tennessee passed   laws. ’OUT OF NOWHERE’ ”It was just out of nowhere,” said Deborah Walsh, then overseeing a Knoxville, Tennessee, abortion clinic that ended up closing because its doctors lacked the requisite hospital affiliation. Walsh said she wanted to sue Tennessee but after talking to national   lawyers, the consensus was that litigation priorities were elsewhere.  The New   Center for Reproductive Rights sued Mississippi in 2012. The group’s lawyers said only one clinic existed in Mississippi and the   rule threatened to shut it down. They succeeded in blocking the rule’s enforcement in a lawsuit that is still ongoing. The Guttmacher Institute’s Nash said if abortion rights supporters had mounted a stronger legal attack against earlier regulations, it might have blunted the momentum that led to the 2013 Texas law. Lawyers for abortion providers said they picked their shots and sued in places where regulations would most curtail abortion availability. ”We have brought cases where the impact has been most extreme,” said Julie Rikelman, litigation director at the Center for Reproductive Rights, representing Whole Woman’s Health, suing Texas in the Supreme Court case. In addition to Texas, five other states passed admitting privileges laws in 2013 and 2014.  Conditions for such privileges vary. Some hospitals require doctors to live within a certain distance of the hospital and admit a minimum number of patients per month. Some hospitals do not offer privileges to doctors who do abortions. At the Supreme Court, the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia could lead to a tie vote, with its four liberals and four conservatives on opposite sides. If the justices split   no national legal precedent would be set but the lower court decision upholding the Texas law would stand. That would leave the Texas law intact and could embolden legislatures in other states with strong opposition to abortion to enact similar measures. It also is possible that conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has voted for the basic right to abortion but endorsed many restrictions, would join the court’s four liberals to strike down the Texas law.  A ruling in the case is due by the end of June. The Supreme Court’s last major abortion ruling was in 2007 when it upheld a federal law banning a   abortion procedure.  (Reporting by Joan Biskupic; Additional reporting by Jilian Mincer; Editing by Amy Stevens and Will Dunham) WASHINGTON As the U. S. Supreme Court navigated a difficult period in which it was short one member for more than a year, justices from across the ideological spectrum often managed to find common ground.

    "text": "Meg Whitman, the head of technology firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co ( ) said on Sunday that Donald Trump was ”unfit” for the U. S. presidency, and criticized New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, whose failed presidential bid she supported, for endorsing him. But, later in the day, Trump picked up another   endorsement, from U. S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a leading conservative. Trump’s insurgent campaign has riven the Republican Party, with party leaders openly discussing how to thwart the will of the tens of thousands of members who have voted for Trump, helping him comfortably win in three of the four states that have so far held nominating contests. Party leaders are nervous that Trump, a billionaire   developer from New York City who deviates from some of the central tenets of Republican conservatism, may alienate voters if he is their candidate in the Nov. 8 general election. He has proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States and declined a journalist’s invitation on Sunday to condemn the Ku Klux Klan, the violent   group. Christie, who scrapped his own presidential bid earlier this month, became the most prominent Republican figure to break ranks with party leadership by endorsing Trump on Friday ahead of this week’s ”Super Tuesday” contests, when voters in 11 states go to the polls. Whitman, who was a   of the national finance committee of Christie’s campaign, said in a statement to reporters that Trump would take the country on ”a dangerous journey” and that Christie was aware of this. ”Chris Christie’s endorsement of Donald Trump is an astonishing display of political opportunism. Donald Trump is unfit to be president” said the statement from Whitman, who is chief executive and president of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and chairman of HP Inc ( ). She called on Christie’s donors not to follow him to Trump, who has predominantly funded his campaign with personal loans. Representatives of Christie and Trump did not respond to requests for comment. Earlier on Sunday, Trump was asked repeatedly if he would unequivocally condemn the Klan and other support from white supremacists. ”I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists,” Trump told CNN’s Jake Tapper after being asked about his endorsement by David Duke, a former Klan leader. ”If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them and certainly I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong.” Previously, Trump had seemed less uncertain about his views on Duke. ”David Duke endorsed me?” he said in a response to a reporter. ”Alright. I disavow. OK?”  His latest backer, Senator Sessions, has had to defend his own controversial comments about the Klan in the past. In 1986, he admitted during an unsuccessful confirmation hearing to become a federal judge that he had said he thought the Klan was ”OK” until he came to believe that some members smoked marijuana. He explained that these remarks were a joke and has since called the Klan ”destestable.”     In a separate interview on Sunday, Trump also defended posting on his Twitter account a quote sometimes attributed to Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini. He told NBC News he did not realize that the quote   ”It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep”   was associated Mussolini but said it did not matter because it was a good aphorism all the same. Many party leaders hope U. S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will somehow overtake Trump before the party’s nominating convention in July, despite Rubio’s not having won any states and lagging behind in Trump in opinion polls.  In recent days, Rubio has taken to adopting Trump’s habit of using adolescent insults to denigrate his rival, suggesting on Friday that Trump urinated in his trousers during last week’s televised debate. Rubio and U. S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the only Republican to yet beat Trump in a primary election, both criticized Trump’s reticence to speak ill of the Klan on Sunday. ”We cannot be a party that nominates someone who refused to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan,” Rubio told a crowd of voters in Purcellville, Virginia, MSNBC reported.

    "text": "Australian Cardinal George Pell said on Sunday the Catholic Church made ”enormous mistakes” and dismissed cases of sexual abuse of children in ”scandalous circumstances” as he became the   Vatican official to testify on Church abuse. Giving evidence in front of abuse victims in a Rome hotel room, Pell told Australia’s Royal Commission into Institutional Response to Child Sexual Abuse that children were often not believed and abusive priests shuffled from parish to parish. ”The Church has made enormous mistakes and is working to remedy those, but the Church in many places, certainly in Australia, has mucked things up, has let people down,” Pell said via video link to the commission in Sydney. ”I’m not here to defend the indefensible.” The Australian inquiry into sexual abuse cases which occurred decades ago has taken on wider implications about accountability of Church leaders because of Pell’s high position in the Vatican, where he now serves as finance minister. Pell, 74, has become the focal point for victims’ frustration over what they say has been an inadequate response from the Catholic Church to the abuse claims. Pell himself is not accused of sexual abuse and has twice apologized for the Church’s slow response. When pressed on specific situations involving particular priests some 40 years ago, Pell repeatedly said he couldn’t recollect the incidents being put to him, at one point citing ”a senior moment” angering witnesses in both Rome and Sydney. ”He is an intelligent man, he is in such a high position, we all have our seniors moments but not on something like this,” Trish Charter, who says she was abused between the ages of four and eight at an orphanage run by the Sisters of Mercy, said in Sydney. Around 15 abuse victims and supporters traveled to Rome on the back of a   campaign to see Pell give evidence after he said he was unable to travel to his native Australia because of heart problems. In Sydney, victims’ supporters gathered outside the Commission’s hearing rooms, holding hands in prayer and carrying signs saying ”Pope Sack Pell Now” and ”Pell go to hell”.  TOO MANY CASES DISMISSED Last year, Pell denied accusations made at Commission hearings that he had tried to bribe a victim to remain quiet, that he ignored another complaint and that he was complicit in the transfer of a pedophile priest. The alleged events took place in the 1970s and 1980s when Pell was a priest in Australia. Australia’s bishops have rallied behind Pell, calling him ”a man of integrity who is committed to the truth”. Pell said on Sunday that too many allegations of abuse ”were dismissed and sometimes they were dismissed in absolutely scandalous circumstances”. ”They were very, very, very plausible allegations made by responsible people that were not followed up sufficiently,” he said, adding he believed the faults were personal rather than structural failings. ”Unfortunately, original sin is alive and well,” Pell said. ”There’s tendency to evil in the Catholic Church too and sometimes it’s better, sometimes it’s worse but for good or for ill the Church follows the patterns of the societies in which it lives.” On Sunday, Pell’s office released a photo of the Cardinal tying a yellow ribbon around a fence in the Vatican Gardens, joining a campaign started by the Australian Loud Fence movement. The group first hung colored ribbons on a fence outside a Catholic school in the rural town of Ballarat, where abuse was rife, with the bright colors designed to give a voice to child victims who were silenced.  Church sexual abuse broke into the open in 2002, when it was discovered that bishops in the Boston area moved abusers from parish to parish instead of defrocking them. Similar scandals have since been discovered around the world and tens of millions of dollars have been paid in compensation. Ironically, the Rome hearing started just hours before the Oscar ceremony in Hollywood, where ”Spotlight” a film about the systematic   of sexual abuse in the Church in Boston, has been nominated for six Academy Awards.

    "text": "The widely predicted failure of G20 leaders to agree on bold new steps to reinvigorate the world economy at a meeting in Shanghai this weekend puts the onus firmly back on central bankers. But after years of increasingly desperate attempts to   growth there is fear among bankers and top finance officials that monetary policy is running out of effective ammunition and future stimulus efforts could even be harmful. ”Monetary policy is extremely accommodative to the point that it may even be counterproductive in terms of negative side effects on banks, policies and growth,” German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said at the G20 meeting.  ”Fiscal as well as monetary policies have reached their limits,” he said. ”If you want the real economy to grow, there are no shortcuts which avoid reforms.” The G20 acknowledged that monetary policy alone is not enough to combat rising global risks but leaders failed to outline concrete steps, making only vague and general pledges. Facing a new paradigm of slow growth and the legacy of crises, top central banks have kept rates near or below zero for years, waiting in vain for governments to embrace reforms instead of pointing the finger at monetary policy.  Testing uncharted waters, smaller central banks in Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark even cut rates deep into negative territory, raising the prospect that monetary policy still had some room left. The BOJ and the ECB both followed suit but the results have been mixed, with side effects. POSSIBLE BUT COSTLY ”Some things may be technically possible, but it’s a different question when it comes to whether they are feasible,” BOJ board members Takahide Kiuchi.  ”The reality in Japan is that it’s gradually becoming difficult to come up with policy steps for which the merits sufficiently outweigh the costs,” Kiuchi said, suggesting that the BOJ may have exhausted its options when it cut its key rate to below zero last month. Although the rate cut pushed bond yields into negative territory, it failed to lift stock prices or stop an unwelcome rise in the yen, meaning that policy is not achieving its goals. In the world of such unconventional monetary policies, the law of diminishing returns apply, so each new measure yields less but carries a greater risk. ”The options are not unlimited,” Swiss National Bank chief Thomas Jordan said. ”The effects of monetary policy measures can wane with duration and dosage.” ”Interest rates . .. cannot continue to be lowered into negative territory without at some point precipitating a flight to cash,” he added. BUBBLES, ZOMBIES Low rates and big central bank asset buys, a key part of  unconventional policy, fuel asset price bubbles, particularly for housing, and keep poorly functioning ”zombie” firms alive through access to cheap credit, slowly eroding competitiveness.  Low rates also depress bank profits, eventually reducing banks ability to lend, while quantitative easing disrupts markets, reducing liquidity and limiting market access. With China, Japan, the ECB and Switzerland all seeking a weaker exchange rate, banks are facing the risk of an open currency war, losing their ability to boost prices and competitiveness through devaluation. ”Central banks should rethink their strategy,” said Michael Heise, chief economist of Allianz, an insurer and one of the world’s biggest investors. ”The power of the central banks is limited. We have been over reliant on central banks to fix the problem but it is not under their control.” Indeed, this time many of the shocks are external, such as slowing emerging market growth and deflationary pressures from low oil prices. These shocks are difficult to counter and weak PMI and confidence indicators in Europe suggest that growth is already taking a hit, despite a 1. 5 trillion euro stimulus program from the ECB. Help could come from fiscal spending but the G20 meeting highlighted that few governments have room to maneuver and the those which could spend more, such as Germany, made it clear they are not going to. That leaves central banks stuck with a need to act and the ECB is almost certain to ease policy on March 10, delivering a small rate cut and a few changes to its assets buys, moves well short of a quantum leap.  Still, if a global crisis flared up again, central banks still have a few powerful, though controversial and potentially illegal tools left.  Economists say that central banks could force commercial lenders to offer loans at a negative interest rate in return for guaranteed earnings, stimulating both growth and investment. That would force central banks to take big losses.  They say a last resort would be to offer ”helicopter money” free cash provided to all euro zone citizens with the aim of stimulating spending and inflation. This was suggested by former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke in 2002 as an effective way to fight deflation but European policymakers have not seriously discussed the idea. It would face fierce resistance from conservative countries like Germany, where even asset purchases have been challenged in court, likely leading to years of legal and political challenges.  It would also be questionable as domestic demand in the euro area is holding up well and cheap central bank money is already providing liquidity.

    "text": "The biggest engineering feat on display when Volkswagen unveils its new concept car on Tuesday will be the team developing it: a   management system crafted to operate faster, cheaper and with a lighter grip on the wheel. Last year’s scandal over falsified diesel emissions tests caused a cull of top managers at Europe’s biggest automaker and brought a promise to overhaul the corporate culture. But the most meaningful management change taking place was already under way when the scandal broke: aimed less at preventing misdeeds than at improving profit margins, which had fallen behind competitors under an inefficient hierarchy. Its concept for the Geneva car show will be the first vehicle the Volkswagen brand develops under a new, decentralized system designed to emulate rival BMW, which has a track record of quickly and efficiently getting new cars to market. VW ( ) will present the concept version of an     vehicle (SUV) in Geneva on Tuesday, three sources at the company said, and will develop the road version more rapidly under the new streamlined process. Analysts following the company say it could lift margins at the core brand as the parent grapples with the costs of its scandal. The move is pioneered by brand chief Herbert Diess who previously oversaw R&D while an executive at BMW, where an agile structure has long allowed expert teams to run vehicle development without interference from top management. Volkswagen has previously been known for a system that spread responsibility for model development across layers of committees and funneled final approval through top executives. Although the need for changes at the VW brand was amplified by the emissions crisis that emerged in September, the former BMW executive had already been pushing decentralization since taking office last July. TIME AND DISCIPLINE Profitability at VW’s core brand, at 2. 8 percent, is less than half its 6 percent goal, and is dwarfed by French rivals PSA Peugeot Citroen’s 5 percent and Renault’s 5. 1 percent. ”Time and cost discipline can be improved very considerably through this structure,” Boston Consulting Group (BCG) senior partner Nikolaus Lang told Reuters. ”Whether the time and cost advantage ultimately is 20 percent or 30 percent depends on the production series and the matureness of the organization.” Future models such as the new SUV, which the sources said will go on sale in 2018, will be developed by teams with full control over technology, quality, costs and launch dates. Four new teams of about 100 experts each will focus on the main production series at VW’s namesake brand, covering small, compact,   and   cars. That is a change from the system under former chief executive Martin Winterkorn, a stickler for detail, who required decisions on development to gain approval of top managers. He resigned in the wake of the emissions crisis. VW aims to significantly shorten the process from concept to production which previously took 48 months, one source said. BMW, by contrast, says its minimum development time for a new model is just 36 months. One source said decisions under Winterkorn could be held up by other items on the executive board’s agenda, or delegated to committees that met only every four weeks, resulting in delays. When VW finalised a sportier look for its Beetle in 2010 without a rear spoiler for the   version, top managers at the last minute ordered suppliers in Mexico to provide the parts and rework the design, the source said. ”We had issues all the time,” a senior VW brand manager told Reuters on condition he not be identified while discussing internal management issues. ”It’s key to correct the problems soon. This is possible if you have people responsible for carrying out all phases of a program.” ”Ideally the various stages to develop a car run simultaneously, not consecutively, if it is to hit targets,” the manager said. ”Our concept was different and, by comparison, strikingly inefficient.” Since January, hundreds of managers at VW’s main Wolfsburg plant have changed offices and moved into four   project houses where strategy is mapped out for the new car groups, said another of the three sources who confirmed the new concept car. Diess told VW managers at a   conference in December that the new structure ”implies a real paradigm change for VW and will take strength”.  LAGGARD Analysts say VW has been a laggard in an industry where most automakers have development teams dedicated to one vehicle program, aiming to shorten work processes as they strive to incorporate new technologies.  BMW launched its system of teams overseeing the whole process of development for a vehicle in the 1990s to contain a growing model count. It has lately refined it by integrating more specialists, a spokesman said. Diess has lured many experts from his former employer and is drawing on Swiss business consultancy Malik for advice, the first source said. VW and Malik declined comment. The sources said the changes would also be implemented at luxury brand Audi.  The new course has risks, analysts say. VW’s push to devolve power may raise demands by operations in China and other markets to develop more   solutions, they said. Labor boss Bernd Osterloh backs the drive for more efficiency but fears an exaggerated boost in productivity could undermine jobs. Tensions may increase this spring when labor and management will start wage talks for about 115, 000 VW workers in Western Germany. Sales projections show VW may be heading in the right direction. VW’s European brand deliveries may rise 4. 4 percent to 2. 15 million cars by 2020 from an estimated 2. 06 million this year, according to research firm IHS Automotive.  ”Those changes are important to weatherproof the brand, but they will need time to take full effect,” said M. M. Warburg analyst   Tonn who recommends holding the stock.

    "text": "Japan’s industrial output rose the most in a year in January, tentatively signaling a pick up in factory activity, but the outlook remains far from assured given global market jitters and weakening demand both at home and abroad.  The 3. 7 percent    gain compared with economists’ median estimate of a 3. 3 percent gain in a Reuters poll, and followed a 1. 7 percent drop in December, trade ministry data showed. It was the fastest gain since January 2015, led by production of cars, electronics parts and   machinery, but manufacturers see poor prospects for industrial output in the coming months. Retail sales fell 0. 1 percent in January    and 1. 1 percent    following a contraction in fourth quarter gross domestic product, underscoring weakness in private consumption which accounts for about 60 percent of the economy. Policymakers will scrutinize coming data, including January household spending due on Tuesday, for more clues to health of the economy. ”Expectations for additional monetary and fiscal policy action could rise if weakness in consumer spending and the broader economy persist,” said Yuta Egashira, economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. ”The risk of two straight quarters of economic contraction cannot be ruled out,” he said, raising the possibility of Japan suffering a technical recession.  Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect output to fall 5. 2 percent in February and grow 3. 1 percent in March. Based on these estimates, output would fall 0. 3 percent over   from the prior quarter, a trade ministry official said. ”Output is probably weaker than the headline figure showed.” BOOMING FOREIGN TOURISM Monday’s indicators followed data out earlier this month showing exports fell the most in January since the 2009 global financial crisis, underscoring the absence of a growth engine for Japan’s economy, the world’s third largest.  A record number of foreign tourists in Japan has been a boost for retailers such as department stores as some of these visitors, Chinese in particular, have gone on a   ”explosive buying” spree. Nevertheless, retail sales fell in January for a third straight month, suggesting mild winter weather and a cooling consumer mood with the rising costs of food and necessities more than offset gains from booming tourism.  Japan’s economy contracted by an annualized 1. 4 percent in   more than expected, as private consumption and exports slumped. Analysts say any recovery in the current quarter will be modest because of weak demand both at home and abroad. The BOJ’s implementation of negative interest rates this month has not helped turn around sentiment, keeping alive speculation that the bank will ease policy again in coming months.

    "text": "India and the United States are closing in on an agreement to share military logistics after 12 years of talks, officials said, a sign of strengthening defense ties between the countries as China becomes increasingly assertive. The United States has emerged as India’s top arms source after years of dominance by Russia, and holds more joint exercises with it than any other country. It is in talks with New Delhi to help build its largest aircraft carrier in the biggest military collaboration to date, a move that will bolster the Indian navy’s strength as China expands its reach in the Indian Ocean. After years of   by previous governments over fears that the logistics agreement would draw India into a binding commitment to support the United States in war, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration has signaled a desire to move ahead with the Logistics Support Agreement (LSA). That would allow the two militaries to use each other’s land, air and naval bases for resupplies, repair and rest, officials said. Admiral Harry Harris, head of the U. S. Navy’s Pacific Command, said the two sides were working on the LSA, another agreement called the CISMOA for secure communications when the militaries operate together, and a third on exchange of topographical, nautical, and aeronautical data. ”We have not gotten to the point of signing them with India, but I think we’re close,” Harris, due in India this week, told the U. S. House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. The progress comes as the countries consider joint maritime patrols that a U. S. official said could include the South China Sea, where China is locked in a territorial dispute with Vietnam, the Philippines and Taiwan among others. [nL3N15P2JZ] Both sides, though, said there were no immediate plans for such patrols, which drew strong condemnation from Beijing. MAIN HURDLE CLEARED An Indian government official said the main impediment to signing the LSA had been cleared, after Washington gave an assurance that New Delhi was not bound by it if the U. S. went to war with a friendly country or undertook any other unilateral action that New Delhi did not support. ”It has been clarified that it will be done on a    basis; it’s not automatic that either side will get access to facilities in the case of war,” the official familiar with the negotiations said. Asked whether China was concerned such cooperation was actually aimed at Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said: ”We hope the relevant cooperation is beneficial to regional peace and cooperation and should not be aimed at the interests of third parties.” India’s previous   government was worried the agreements would undermine India’s strategic autonomy and that it would draw it into an undeclared military alliance with the United States. Concerns linger over the proposed communications agreement, with some branches of the military including the air force fearing it would allow the United States to access their communications network. U. S. officials said they hoped that once the logistics agreement was signed, the others would follow. A U. S. defense industry source engaged in business in India said there were expectations the LSA could be sealed by the time U. S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter visited New Delhi in April.  The source said Modi’s office was directly involved in the matter and actively considering the agreements as a key for enhanced cooperation. India has been alarmed by Chinese naval forays into the Indian Ocean and its involvement in maritime infrastructure on island nations that it traditionally considered its back yard. It has moved to shore up naval forces and build defense ties with Japan and Vietnam, besides the United States. ”There is growing convergence between Obama’s Asia pivot and Modi’s Act East policy,” said Saroj Bishoyi, an expert on the proposed  . S. collaboration at the   Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses in New Delhi. ”The LSA currently appears to be a doable agreement.”  (Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in BEIJING; Writing by Sanjeev Miglani; Editing by Mike  ) QAMISHLI,   The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near   areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a ”declaration of war” which could trigger clashes within days.

    "text": "As sea levels rise, threatening cities from New York to Shanghai, the economic damage will increase even faster, scientists said on Monday. Extreme floods whipped up by storms will become ever more costly for cities as ocean levels edge up around the world’s coasts in coming decades, they wrote in a study that could help guide governments budgeting to protect everything from buildings and basements to metro systems. ”The damage from sea level rise rises faster than sea level rise itself,”   Juergen Kropp, part of a team at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told Reuters of the findings. For the Danish capital Copenhagen, for instance, a moderate sea level rise of 11 cm (4 inches) by 2050 from 2010 levels would cause about a billion euros ($1. 1 billion) a year in extra damage if no protective action is taken, the study estimated. But the costs would quadruple to 4 billion euros if the rate of sea level rise roughly doubles to 25 cm by 2050, in line with the worst scenarios projected by a U. N. scientific panel, they wrote in the journal Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences. World sea levels are creeping higher, the U. N. panel says, partly because global warming is adding water to the oceans by melting glaciers from the Andes to the Alps and parts of vast ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. The Potsdam scientists said that mathematical models they developed to estimate rising costs would work around the world. ”You can apply it in Tokyo, New York or Mumbai,” Kropp said. The exact costs of sea level rise, which could in the worst case reach about a meter by 2100, are extremely uncertain. One study in 2014 estimated it could cost anywhere from 0. 3 percent to 9 percent of world gross domestic product a year by 2100. Jochen Hinkel of the Global Climate Forum in Berlin, the lead author of that study, said it illustrated vast risks but was based on the implausible assumption that governments would take no protective action.  Building coastal barriers would be far cheaper, Hinkel said. ”People have adapted to   rise in the past and will do so in the future,” he said, noting protective measures for  cities such as Tokyo or Jakarta, which have been sinking relative to sea level because of local subsidence.

    "text": "Chinese power and electrical group Shanghai Electric ( ) has agreed to buy at least a quarter of German technology group Manz ( ) in a deal that could lead to a full takeover offer, Manz said on Sunday. The acquisition, the latest in a recent string of Chinese takeovers of German technology companies, will be carried out through a rights issue in which Manz will issue new shares to increase its capital by about 43 percent. The German group, which makes machines to produce solar panels, smartphone displays and batteries, and counts Apple ( ) as a major customer, said the rights issue would give Shanghai Electric at least 27 percent of the newly expanded share pool or a maximum of 29. 9 percent.   The deal shows the growing momentum of Chinese buyers as they race to acquire expertise in technologies deemed strategic by their government. The increasing Chinese appetite has enabled German sellers to obtain better prices than they would otherwise fetch. So far this year ChemChina has agreed to buy German industrial machinery maker KraussMaffei for $1 billion, Beijing Enterprises Holdings ( ) to buy Germany’s Energy from Waste for 1. 44 billion euros ($1. 62 billion) and Chengdu Techcent Environment Co ( ) to buy Bilfinger’s ( ) water treatment unit for 200 million euros.  Manz, which reported a loss for the first nine months of 2015, had said it was carrying out a strategic review of its solar business along with a group restructuring. The company has a market value of 204 million euros ($223 million). Shanghai Electric has agreed to buy all of the new Manz shares not subscribed to by existing shareholders, including a 35. 2 percent stake held by Chief Executive Dieter Manz, and a further 3. 8 percent owned by his wife Ulrike Manz, both of whom will not exercise their subscription rights. The subscription offer for the new shares is expected to take place during the first six months of 2016 and the price will be set as close as possible to the market, up to a maximum of 40 euros per share, Manz said.  Manz shares closed at 37. 35 euros on Friday. Manz and Shanghai Electric also agreed to allow the Chinese group to request voting rights from Dieter Manz, enabling it to reach the 30 percent threshold that would trigger a mandatory takeover offer to other shareholders.

    "text": "WASHINGTON   A Donald Trump rally in Virginia was repeatedly disrupted on Monday by protesters, including some from the Black Lives Matter movement, in a stark display of the divisions the Republican  ’s presidential campaign has long been accused of sowing. A Time magazine photographer trying to document the exit of dozens of black protesters from the rally in southwestern Radford, Virginia, was grabbed by the neck and shoved to the ground by a U. S. Secret Service agent. Hecklers disrupted the rally on a day when the New York billionaire fended off criticism that he had not clearly condemned white supremacist support during an interview on CNN on Sunday. Trump taunted the protesters, shouting ”Are you from Mexico?” at one of them. Supporters in the audience confronted the hecklers in angry,    exchanges. As black protesters were escorted from the rally, the crowd around them began to chant, ”All lives matter.” Trump waited for the scene to quiet down before saying, ”Folks, you’re going to hear it once: All lives matter.” The crowd roared with applause.   Black Lives Matter is a civil rights movement that sprang from police shootings of black Americans in recent years. The Trump rally took place on the eve of Super Tuesday, the biggest voting day in the race to pick the 2016 presidential nominees for the November election. A number of Southern states including Virginia are holding contests on Tuesday, and opinion polls show Trump is likely to consolidate his status as favorite to win the Republican nomination. It was unclear whether Trump would be damaged by support from white supremacists. He has risen in opinion polls and won three of four early nominating contests while proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, calling Mexican immigrants criminals and insulting women. His rivals for the Republican nomination, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, urged him to ask the New York Times to release a recording of his recent interview with its editorial board, following a report he told it he was not serious about his immigration proposals. ’GET THEM OUT’ On Monday, the protesters disrupted Trump’s remarks several times for long stretches, prompting him to shout to security guards several times, ”Get them out please, get them out.”  Trump appeared to relish the discord, saying after the turmoil in the crowd that his rallies were more exciting than those of the other candidates: ”But it is fun, and exciting.” At a rally last week in Nevada, Trump also jumped into the fray with a protester when he said, ”I’d like to punch him in the face.” Time photographer Chris Morris was on the fringe of an enclosed media section when he was seized by an agent from the  Secret Service, which has the job of protecting the U. S. president and some White House candidates. ”I stepped 18 inches out of the (press) pen and then he grabbed me by the neck and started choking me and then he slammed me to the ground,” Morris told CNN at the scene. The Trump campaign said it was not aware of the details of the incident and directed inquires to local law enforcement. Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback said the agency was aware of the incident involving one of its employees but it still working to ”determine the exact circumstances that led up to this incident.” Earlier on Monday, Trump’s rivals criticized him for equivocating on white supremacist support when he was asked repeatedly on CNN if he would condemn the Klan and disavow support from white supremacists, including David Duke, a former Klan grand wizard from Louisiana. Trump said that he had been hampered by a faulty earpiece during the CNN interview. Duke on Monday denied that he had endorsed Trump. But he said he planned to vote for him and had advised his friends to do so too because of the candidate’s views on immigration and world peace. Duke told Fox News Radio he disapproved of Trump’s ”lip service” in support of Israel, but ”I told my people to vote for him in the election” for strategic reasons.

    "text": "Canada and the U. S. have announced a cooperative plan to tackle climate change by cutting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, investing in clean energy research and reducing future hydrofluorocarbon use. At a joint press conference in the White House Rose Garden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Obama praised the strong ties between Canada and the U. S. They also announced plans to further facilitate trade between the two countries and expressed a shared commitment to protect the environment. ”As the first U. S. president to visit the Arctic, I saw how both of our nations are threatened by rising seas, melting permafrost, disappearing glaciers and sea ice,” Obama said. ”The president and I share a common goal: We want a   economy that continues to provide good jobs and great opportunities for all of our citizens,” Trudeau said. ”And I’m confident that by working together, we’ll get there sooner than we think.” Trudeau’s visit to the White House is the first by a sitting Canadian prime minister in nearly two decades. And the collaborative approach to regulating the oil and gas industry comes after years of tension between the Obama and Canadian leaders over the White House’s opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline. Trudeau, who assumed his post in November, is just starting his time as the leader of Canada Obama, for his part, is in his final year in office. But Obama told reporters he’s confident that their agreement will survive the next administration. The two leaders have committed to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent, relative to 2012 levels, by 2025, and to join a World Bank campaign to reduce routine flaring at gas and oil operations. Their joint statement on climate change efforts included a number of other shared commitments, including: The Keystone XL pipeline  —   which strained ties between the U. S. and Canada over the past few years, and dominated discussions of energy between the two nations  —   was not mentioned. The two leaders also expressed a desire to collaborate to protect the Arctic beyond reducing the impact of climate change. They set a goal of protecting 17 percent of Arctic land and 10 percent of marine areas, and said they were committed to involving indigenous leaders, as well as traditional knowledge, in decisions related to the Arctic. The shared commitment to fighting climate change, in particular, was received as a significant shift in both nations’ positions. Last year, NPR’s Christopher Joyce wrote that when it came to international cooperation on climate change, ”the U. S. government has been like the   movie star who has been offered the lead role, but won’t commit.” And Canada? In The New Republic last fall, Rebecca Leber called Canada under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper a ”climate villain.” With Thursday’s joint statement, Obama and Trudeau indicated they now want their countries to step to the forefront of the global conversation on climate change. ”We know that our international partners expect  —   and indeed need  —   leadership from us on this issue,” Trudeau said.",

    "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday their countries would cooperate in the fight against climate change, just days after the U. S. withdrew from the Paris climate agreement.  Modi, whose country is the world’s   emissions generator, said in Russia on Friday that he would continue to back the deal and Macron has said the 2015 Paris agreement is irreversible despite U. S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw. ”The protection of the environment and the mother planet is an article of faith,” Modi said at a joint news conference with Macron in Paris.  The two leaders, who met for the first time, announced no contracts or new initiatives.  ”We are both convinced that our countries have to do a lot for the ecological and environmental transition and the fight against global warming,” Macron said, adding that France would go above and beyond its Paris agreement commitments.  He said he planned a visit to India before   for a first summit of the International Solar Alliance, an initiative launched by New Delhi and Paris during the Paris climate talks. Macron said the alliance will lead to concrete measures in favor of solar energy and commit the companies of both nations.  The alliance seeks to mobilize more than a trillion dollars by 2030 and bring together well over 100   countries to deliver solar energy to some of the planet’s poorest. The two leaders said they had also discussed how to combat terrorism and that they would work on concrete initiatives before the end of the year to fight terrorism on the internet. Ties between the two countries have grown in recent years most notably in the defense sector with New Delhi ordering 36   Rafale fighter jets. The two countries are also in talks about nuclear power and French utility EDF in Jan. 2016 signed a preliminary pact to build six   European Pressurised Reactors (EPR) at Jaitapur, on India’s western coast. But last month, India’s cabinet approved plans to build 10 reactors of indigenous Indian design and said that India will not buy foreign reactors unless these reactors are already in operation. Four EPRs are under construction in France, Finland and China, but all are years behind schedule and not a single EPR is in operation yet.

    "text": "The U. S. Energy Department said on Tuesday it will not comply with a request from   Donald Trump’s Energy Department transition team for the names of people who have worked on climate change and the professional society memberships of lab workers. The Energy Department’s response could signal a rocky transition for the  ’s energy team and potential friction between the new leadership and the staffers who remain in place. The memo sent to the Energy Department on Tuesday and reviewed by Reuters last week contains 74 questions, including a request for a list of all department employees and contractors who attended the annual global climate talks hosted by the United Nations within the last five years. Energy Department spokesman Eben   said Tuesday the department will not comply. ”Our career workforce, including our contractors and employees at our labs, comprise the backbone of (the Energy Department) and the important work our department does to benefit the American people,”   said. ”We are going to respect the professional and scientific integrity and independence of our employees at our labs and across our department,” he added. ”We will be forthcoming with all publicly available information with the transition team. We will not be providing any individual names to the transition team.” He added that the request ”left many in our workforce unsettled.” Andrew Rosenberg, an official at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the Energy Department ”made the right choice in refusing this absurd and dangerous request. Federal agencies need the best available science to respond to the growing risk of climate change.” Reuters reported late Monday that former Texas Governor Rick Perry is expected to be named by Trump to run the Energy Department. The agency employs more than 90, 000 people working on nuclear weapons maintenance and research labs, nuclear energy, advanced renewable energy, batteries and climate science. The memo sought a list of all department employees or contractors who have attended any meetings on the social cost of carbon, a measurement that federal agencies use to weigh the costs and benefits of new energy and environmental regulations. It also asked for all publications written by employees at the department’s 17 national laboratories for the past three years. Trump transition officials declined to comment on the memo. ”This feels like the first draft of an eventual political enemies list,” a Department of Energy employee, who asked not to be identified because he feared a reprisal by the Trump transition team, had told Reuters. Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman, said in a news briefing on Tuesday that the queries ”could have been an attempt to target civil servants,” including ”scientists and lawyers and other experts who are critical to the success of the federal government’s ability to make policy.”  By design, their work transcends the term of any one president, Earnest said.  Trump, a Republican, said during his election campaign that climate change was a hoax perpetrated by China to damage U. S. manufacturing. He said he would rip up last year’s landmark global climate deal struck in Paris that was signed by President Barack Obama. Since winning the Nov. 8 election, however, Trump has said he will keep an ”open mind” about the Paris deal. He also met with former Vice President Al Gore, a strong advocate for action on climate change.  After that meeting, he picked Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a climate change skeptic, to head the Environmental Protection Agency.

    "text": "The governors of the three U. S. West Coast states on Tuesday vowed to step up their efforts to fight climate change in the face of the incoming administration of   Donald Trump, who has dismissed global warming as a hoax. Democratic governors Jerry Brown of California, Jay Inslee of Washington and Katherine Brown of Oregon made stark warnings that climate change was already harming the Pacific Ocean along which their states lie. ”Our waters are at mortal risk,” said Inslee, speaking via   at a meeting of the International Alliance to Combat Ocean Acidification, in advance of the winter meeting of the Western Governors Association in Coronado near San Diego. The three governors said they had joined the alliance, a group of U. S. states and countries including Chile and France dedicated to reducing rising acidity in the oceans, a phenomenon tied to climate change that threatens fish, coral reefs and other marine life.     Jerry Brown also said that he had sent a letter to U. S. President Barack Obama, asking him to make permanent a recent    on oil drilling off the coast of the most populous U. S. state. The actions marked the latest in a series of moves by Democrats, led by California, to position themselves to fight efforts by Trump to undo progressive policies on the environment, immigration, healthcare and other issues.  The three coastal states are also among eight U. S. states and the District of Columbia to have recently legalized the recreational use of marijuana, actions that may also conflict with the agenda of the incoming Republican administration.  A conservative populist who campaigned against illegal immigration, expressed skepticism of the science behind climate change and vowed to repeal Obama’s signature healthcare law, Trump has said he wants Cabinet members with similar beliefs. Earlier this month, the California governor nominated Xavier Becerra, a lawyer and longtime California congressman to be attorney general in a move widely viewed as preparation to defend state policies against a Trump Administration.  On Tuesday, Jerry Brown said that despite whatever obstruction the incoming Trump Administration poses to efforts to combat climate change, California would do everything possible to prevent catastrophic global warming and ocean acidification.  The oceans absorb 90 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases, and supply much of the world’s food. ”Whatever problems we have today, they will pale to the stresses that we are going to have by rising sea levels, the threat of tropical diseases, and all manner of extreme weather events,” Jerry Brown said.

    "text": "Donald Trump said Sunday that “nobody really knows” whether climate change is real and that he is “studying” whether the United States should withdraw from the global warming agreement struck in Paris a year ago. In an interview with “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace, Trump said he’s “very  ” on whether climate change is underway but has serious concerns about how President Obama’s efforts to cut carbon emissions have undercut America’s global competitiveness. “I’m still  . Nobody really knows,” Trump said. “Look, I’m somebody that gets it, and nobody really knows. It’s not something that’s so hard and fast. I do know this: Other countries are eating our lunch. ”  There is a broad scientific consensus that human activity  —   including the burning of fossil fuels for transportation, heating and industrial manufacturing  —   is driving recent climate change. In its most recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that it is “extremely likely” that, since the 1950s, humans and their greenhouse gas emissions have been the “dominant cause” of the planet’s warming trend. The top 10 hottest years on record have all been since 1998, and 2016 is expected to be the hottest year since formal   began in 1880. But it’s not the first time that Trump has disregarded that established scientific view. During the presidential campaign, Trump referred to climate change as a “hoax” perpetrated by the Chinese, a comment he later described as a joke. But during a town hall in New Hampshire, he also mocked the idea of global warming. At that event, Meghan Andrade, a volunteer for the League of Conservation Voters, asked Trump what he would do to address the issue, to which he replied: “Let me ask you this  —   take it easy, fellas  —   how many people here believe in global warming? Do you believe in global warming?” After asking three times “Who believes in global warming?” and soliciting a show of hands, Trump concluded that “nobody” believed climate change was underway except for Andrade. During Sunday’s interview with Wallace, Trump said he needed to balance any environmental regulation against the fact that manufacturers and other businesses in China and elsewhere are able to operate without the kind of restrictions faced by their U. S. competitors. “If you look at what  —   I could name country after country. You look at what’s happening in Mexico, where our people are just  —   plants are being built, and they don’t wait 10 years to get an approval to build a plant, okay?” he said. “They build it like the following day or the following week. We can’t let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs. ” The U. S. has outpaced the rest of the developed world in terms of growth since the 2008 recession, though developing countries such as China boast higher growth rates. Typically, economists compare the U. S. against other industrialized nations since developing countries typically grow faster than their developed counterparts. The New York businessman made the same critique of the Environmental Protection Agency, to which he has nominated Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt  —   a climate change skeptic  —   as the head. Wallace asked whether he was “going to take a wrecking ball to the Obama legacy,” to which Trump replied, “No. No. No. I don’t want to do that at all.  I just want what’s right. ” “EPA, you can’t get things approved. I mean, people are waiting in line for 15 years before they get rejected, okay? ” he said. “That’s why people don’t want to invest in this country. ” It is unclear which permit application Trump was referring to, but he has repeatedly criticized EPA rules. And though he has given mixed signals on whether he would back out of the United States’ voluntary commitments under the Paris climate agreement, it would take several years for the next administration to withdraw now that the agreement has entered into force.  Last week Trump’s transition team for the Energy Department asked officials there to identify which employees have participated in international climate negotiations or worked on domestic efforts to cut greenhouse gases, such as calculating the social cost of carbon. Several scientists, federal union officials and public watchdog groups have expressed concern that these individuals could be targeted for retaliation once Trump takes office.      The Trump transition team has issued a list of 74 questions for the Energy Department, asking officials there to identify which department employees and contractors have worked on forging an international climate pact as well as domestic efforts to cut the nation’s carbon output.

    "text": "“Today, Shanghai air really has a layered taste. At first, it tastes slightly astringent with some smokiness. Upon full contact with your palate, the aftertaste has some earthy bitterness, and upon careful distinguishing you can even feel some   particulate matter,” Alan Yu, a gourmet chef who lives in Shanghai, told The Telegraph in 2013.  Yu got to know those tastes pretty well. In January of that year, a   cloud of toxic air pollution smothered the plains of eastern China, shrouding the skylines of China’s largest cities in a sickly   fog. The U. S. Embassy in Beijing reported that levels of PM 2. 5 —  a type of particulate air pollution that seeps into lung, vein, and heart tissue —  surged above 850 micrograms per cubic meter the UN says that 20 micrograms per cubic meter is the highest safe level. Schools, highways, and airports closed. More than 7, 000 children were sent to Beijing Children’s Hospital on a single day. At least 50 of the country’s 74 major cities exceeded national   standards. The episode remains the worst haze pollution ever recorded in the month of January. Something was strange about the smog. Usually smog will dissipate when sources of air pollution —  like cars or factories —  shut down for a time. But this cloud was stubborn. As part of solar new year celebrations in February 2013, millions of families drove their cars out of Beijing to go on vacation, and the government ordered all factories to cease operations. The smog didn’t subside much, and less than a week later the   “airpocalypse” returned as bad as before. What made the winter smog so bad that year —  and in the winters since, which have also been stubbornly smoggy? Two new studies revisit the episode. Both of them argue that climate change will make this kind of smog event much more common. And, remarkably, one of them asserts that the Chinese smog of January 2013 was worsened by two weather phenomena thousands of miles away. Because the Arctic Ocean froze less than it usually does, and because    snowdrifts piled up across the boreal forests of Russia, millions of Chinese people were subjected to some of the worst air pollution ever measured. That’s because the smog of January 2013 wasn’t the result of emissions alone: Weather played the accomplice. For most of that winter, air over eastern China barely circulated. Trade winds went dormant, so smog could not ventilate to the east and vertical circulation slowed, meaning particulate matter could not float up into the higher atmosphere. And as is typical for Chinese winters, rain never arrived to wash air pollution out. The first paper, published Monday in Nature Climate Change, uses an ensemble of 15 climate models to suggest that those wind conditions —  which lead to a stagnation of air across China’s most populated regions —  are more likely to occur in the century to come. The   conditions are 50 percent more likely to form between 2050 and 2099 than they were from 1950 to 1999. And once those patterns fall into place in any one episode, they are 80 percent more likely to persist. These calculations assumed a   emissions scenario, so any reduction in projected   emissions (to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, for instance) would likely reduce the frequency and persistence of haze episodes. A second paper goes further. A team at Georgia Tech asked: What in the world, specifically, shaped those wind patterns? They applied a rudimentary form of artificial intelligence to historical climate and pollution data. Ultimately, they found two big influences: the extent that the Arctic Ocean has frozen over, and the amount of Siberia and the Russian far east covered in snow. These shape the climate of China mostly through their differing temperatures. And when the Arctic is especially warm, and Siberia is covered with snow and especially cold, they combine to reduce the   gradient across Asia. This weakens the pull of the East Asian monsoon wind and leaves air stagnating across eastern China. “In our analysis, these two effects have a similar impact. And if you put them together, you have a bigger impact,” said Yuhang Wang, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at Georgia Tech. These two weather events seem to be getting more common, and more intense, as the climate keeps warming. This means that even as China succeeds in reducing some of its emissions, the winter haze may worsen for meteorological reasons. Really, this is what’s already happening: Even in January 2013, there was no reported massive surge in factory emissions. The sudden   of smog was all meteorology. “I see this as an offsetting effect,” Wang told me. “Polar,   changes are offsetting the effort that China has been putting into emissions reductions. ” Noelle Selin, a professor of Earth and atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the paper was important because it showed how local weather could shape global air pollution. “It’s a real different approach than has been traditionally taken,” she told me. Most smog research uses an   model and not a model of the planet’s entire climate system. “And I think we definitely need both approaches. ” She added that she had pondered whether sea ice or Eurasian snow were shaping   patterns in the United States or Europe. “Being able to quantitatively test [that effect] is a really unique contribution of this paper,” she said. Though there’s been research into how climate affects air pollution, it mostly focuses on the more developed parts of the world. Wang’s team at Georgia Tech, for instance, has found that dry, warm, autumnal air in the American southeast is leading to   ozone pollution in the region, even though industrial emissions levels are down. Fewer studies have focused on China because its contemporary   problem is so dire. But studies like this help reveal why addressing air pollution and climate change are twin political priorities for Beijing. If air pollution is a political problem today, imagine how bad it could be when climate change intensifies it. And President Xi also has a   reason to figure out winter pollution: Beijing is hosting the Winter Olympics in 2022.   Speaking of low Arctic ice and smog over Beijing, Selin said she could think of few other atmospheric phenomena where such distant events were so closely correlated. The best examples, she said, were the periodic temperature swings in the oceans, like El Niño and La Niña. Yet the fact of this world is that there is always a vast and planetary dance, where silent icebergs in a cold, dark sea shape the pollution that skips across an urbane chef’s tongue.",

    "text": "TAORMINA, Sicily (AP)  —   Seven wealthy democracies ended their summit Saturday in Italy without unanimous agreement on climate change, as the Trump administration plans to take more time to say whether the U. S. is going to remain in the Paris accord on limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The other six nations in the Group of Seven agreed to stick with their commitment to implement the 2015 Paris deal that aims to slow down global warming. The final   statement, issued after two days of talks in the seaside town of Taormina, said the U. S. “is in the process of reviewing its policies on climate change and on the Paris agreement and thus is not in a position to join the consensus on these topics. ” Trump tweeted he would decide on Paris next week. The announcement on the final day of the U. S. president’s first international trip comes after he declined to commit to staying in the sweeping climate deal, resisting intense international pressure from his peers at the summit. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, who chaired the meeting, said the other six “won’t change our position on climate change one millimeter. The U. S. hasn’t decided yet. I hope they decide in the right way. ” Gentiloni said climate was “not a minor point” and that he hoped the United States would decide “soon and well” because the Paris accords “need the contribution of the United States. ” French President Emmanuel Macron also chimed in on the climate issue, praising Trump’s “capacity to listen. ” Macron said he told Trump it is “indispensable for the reputation of the United States and the interest of the Americans themselves that the United States remain committed” to the Paris climate agreement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was more downbeat, calling the   climate talks “very difficult, if not to say, very unsatisfactory. ” Trump held no news conferences during his   overseas trip, allowing him to avoid questions about investigations into his campaign’s ties with Russian officials. His top economic and national security advisers refused to answer questions during a press briefing Saturday. The   leaders had better luck finding agreement on the other problematic topic at the summit, trade. They restored a vow to fight protectionism  —   the use of import taxes and skewed regulations that favor domestic producers over their foreign competitors. The   pledge had been a part of previous   statements but was omitted after a meeting of the group’s finance ministers’ earlier this month in Bari, Italy. This time the   leaders reiterated a “commitment to keep our markets open and to fight protectionism. ” The Trump administration has argued that trade must be balanced and fair as well as free. His Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has said the United States reserves the right to be protectionist if trade arrangements are unfair to U. S. companies and workers. Trump’s position appeared to be addressed by new language that said the member countries would be “standing firm against all unfair trade practices. ” Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the   also agreed to step up pressure on North Korea, including sanctions. He told reporters it was the first time that the   had recognized the North Korean threat as a priority issue. “The threat has entered a new stage (as North Korea tests missiles and nuclear weapons)   …     there is a danger it can spread like a contagious disease,” Abe said. The leaders also agreed on two other topics: closer cooperation against terrorism in the wake of the concert bombing in Manchester that killed 22 people, and on the possibility of putting more sanctions against Russia over its conflict with Ukraine if Russian behavior requires that. Alden Meyer, the director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group in Washington, said the discord over climate change was unusual for   meetings. “There have been differences, to be sure, in some past summits, but not a sharp open split like this,” he said. Meyer said many U. S. states, cities, and companies are moving forward on climate action while the Trump administration is “waffling” on the Paris Agreement. “President Trump should join these leaders in protecting Americans from the mounting impacts of climate change and reaping the economic benefits of the clean energy revolution, rather than trying to shore up the flagging fortunes of the polluting coal and oil industries,” Meyer said. The   is an informal gathering that meets every year under a rotating chairmanship. Its decisions are not binding as an international treaty would be, simply representing the leaders’ political commitment to carry through on their collective decisions.

    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP)  —   A divided Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to halt enforcement of President Barack Obama’s sweeping plan to address climate change until after legal challenges are resolved. The surprising move is a blow to the administration and a victory for the coalition of 27 mostly   states and industry opponents that call the regulations ”an unprecedented power grab.” By temporarily freezing the rule the high court’s order signals that opponents have made a strong argument against the plan. A federal appeals court last month refused to put it on hold. The court’s four liberal justices said they would have denied the request. The plan aims to stave off the worst predicted impacts of climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions at existing power plants by about   by 2030. Appellate arguments are set to begin June 2. The compliance period starts in 2022, but states must submit their plans to the Environmental Protection Administration by September or seek an extension. Many states opposing the plan depend on economic activity tied to such fossil fuels as coal, oil and gas. They argued that power plants will have to spend billions of dollars to begin complying with a rule that may end up being overturned. Implementation of the rules is considered essential to the United States meeting   targets in a global climate agreement signed in Paris last month. The Obama administration and environmental groups also say the plan will spur new   jobs. To convince the high court to temporarily halt the plan, opponents had to convince the justices that there was a ”fair prospect” the court would strike down the rule. The court also had to consider whether denying a stay would cause irreparable harm to the states and utility companies affected.",

    "text": "UNITED NATIONS (AP)  —   Leaders from 175 countries signed the Paris Agreement on climate change Friday as the landmark deal took a key step forward, potentially entering into force years ahead of schedule. U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry, holding his young granddaughter, joined dozens of world leaders for a signing ceremony that set a record for international diplomacy: Never have so many countries signed an agreement on the first available day. States that don’t sign Friday have a year to do so. ”We are in a race against time,” U. N.   Ban   told the gathering. ”The era of consumption without consequences is over.” Many now expect the climate agreement to enter into force long before the original deadline of 2020. Some say it could happen this year. After signing, countries must formally approve the Paris Agreement through their domestic procedures. The United Nations says 15 countries, several of them small island states under threat from rising seas, did that Friday by depositing their instruments of ratification. China, the world’s top carbon emitter, announced it will ”finalize domestic procedures” to ratify theParis Agreement before the   summit in China in September. Ban immediately welcomed the pledge. Kerry said the United States ”absolutely intends to join” the agreement this year. The world is watching anxiously: Analysts say that if the agreement enters into force before President Barack Obama leaves office in January, it would be more complicated for his successor to withdraw from the deal because it would take four years to do so under the agreement’s rules. China’s climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, said his government hopes the United States will join the climate agreement ”as soon as possible.” The United States put the deal into economic terms. ”The power of this agreement is what it is going to do to unleash the private sector,” Kerry told the gathering, noting that this year is again shaping up to be the hottest year on record. Ban warned that the work ahead will be enormously expensive. ”Far more than $100 billion   indeed, trillions of dollars   is needed to realize a global,   economy,” he said. The agreement will enter into force once 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions have formally joined it. An analysis by the   World Resources Institute found that at least 25 countries representing 45 percent of global emissions joined the agreement Friday or committed to joining it early. French President Francois Hollande, the first to sign the agreement, said Friday he will ask parliament to ratify it by this summer. France’s environment minister is in charge of global climate negotiations. ”There is no turning back now,” Hollande told the gathering. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also announced that his country would ratify the agreement this year. Other countries that said Friday they intend to join the agreement this year include Mexico and Australia. The climate ceremony brought together a wide range of states that on other issues might sharply disagree. North Korea’s foreign minister made a rare U. N. appearance to sign Friday, and Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe brought applause when he declared, ”Life itself is at stake in this combat. We have the power to win it.” Countries that have not yet indicated they would sign the agreement Friday include some of the world’s largest oil producers, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Nigeria and Kazakhstan, the World Resources Institute said. The Paris Agreement, the world’s response to hotter temperatures, rising seas and other impacts of climate change, was reached in December as a major breakthrough in U. N. climate negotiations, which for years were slowed by disputes between rich and poor countries over who should do what. Under the agreement, countries set their own targets for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The targets are not legally binding, but countries must update them every five years. Already, states face pressure to do more. Scientific analyses show the initial set of targets that countries pledged before Paris don’t match the agreement’s   goal to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3. 6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with   times. Global average temperatures have already climbed by almost 1 degree Celsius. Last year was the hottest on record. The latest analysis by the Climate Interactive research group shows the Paris pledges put the world on track for 3. 5 degrees Celsius of warming. A separate analysis by Climate Action Tracker, a European group, projected warming of 2. 7 degrees Celsius. Either way, scientists say the consequences could be catastrophic in some places, wiping out crops, flooding coastal areas and melting Arctic sea ice. ”This is not a good deal for our island nations, at least not yet,” the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, Nauru President Baron Divavesi Waqa, told the gathering. ”The hardest work starts now.” As the Paris Agreement moves forward, there is some good news. Global energy emissions, the biggest source of   greenhouse gases, were flat last year even though the global economy grew, according to the International Energy Agency. Still, fossil fuels are used much more widely than renewable sources like wind and solar power. Friday was chosen for the signing ceremony because it is Earth Day.

    "text": "Siberia’s enormous “hellmouth” crater in the melting permafrost is growing fast  —   and it’s opening a portal to a    world. The Batgaika crater, known to the local Yakutian people as the “doorway to the underworld,” is one of the largest of a growing number of pits collapsing across the Siberian landscape as the ice beneath the surface turns to slush  —   and methane gas. But this crater in particular offers some form of a silver lining. It’s revealing eons of climate change in the region, along with   animal carcasses and petrified forests. The       crater is growing at the rate of 30 to 100 feet a year as the ice around its edges gives way. Researchers say it’s also getting gradually deeper. But   that, along with its ominous release of greenhouse gas, the stratified layers of the crater’s sides are releasing immense historical climate data. Preserved in the melting permafrost are layers of pollen revealing that the area was once covered by open tundra. But there are also two prominent bands of tree stumps, showing the land was once dense forest. Among it all are the remains of ancient mammoth, musk ox, and even a    horse. Put together, it’s all painting a picture of gradual changes in climate over the course of tens of thousands of years. Researchers hope it will help them predict what will happen in coming decades. University of Sussex professor Julian Murton says the last time Siberia appears to have experienced the formation of “hellsmouth” craters was 10, 000 years ago  —   when the Earth woke from the last ice age. One   remnant sits above an even older landscape that had been heavily eroded. “This was probably when permafrost thawed in a past episode of climate warming,” Murton said. But greenhouse gas levels in our atmosphere are much higher now than then. Current figures place the saturation level at 400 parts per million of CO2. Back then, it was 280 parts per million.

    "text": "A    girl has filed a lawsuit against the Indian government for failing to take action on climate change, warning that young people will pay the price for the country’s inaction.  In the petition filed with the National Green Tribunal, a special court for   cases, Ridhima Pandey said the government had failed to implement its environment laws.  “As a young person [Ridhima] is part of a class that amongst all Indians is most vulnerable to changes in climate, yet are not part of the decision making process,” the   petition reads. It calls on the tribunal to direct the government “to take effective,   action to reduce and minimise the adverse impacts of climate change”. Speaking to the Independent in the UK, Ridhima said: “My government has failed to take steps to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are causing extreme climate conditions. This will impact both me and future generations.  “My country has huge potential to reduce the use of fossil fuels, and because of the government’s inaction I approached the National Green Tribunal. ” India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the Central Pollution Control Board have been asked to respond within two weeks.  India has four of the 10 worst cities in the world in terms of air pollution. Together, India and China accounted for more than half the total number of global deaths attributable to air pollution in 2015, according to a recent study. Greenpeace released a report in January estimating that nearly 1. 2 million Indians die each year owing to high concentrations of airborne pollutants such as dust, mould spores, arsenic, lead, nickel and the carcinogen chromium. At the time, India’s environment minister declared the report inconclusive, adding: “There is no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct   of death exclusively with air pollution. ”  Despite several laws to protect India’s forests, clean up its rivers and improve air quality, critics are concerned that implementation is poor and economic growth often takes precedence over the environment.  Flash floods and landslides in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, where Ridhima lives, killed hundreds of people and left tens of thousands homeless in 2013.  The devastation affected Ridhima, the daughter of an environmental activist, according to Rahul Choudhary, a lawyer representing her. “For someone so young, she is very aware of the issue of climate change and she is very concerned about how it will impact her in future,” he said.  “She wanted to do something that can have a meaningful effect, and we suggested she could file a petition against the government. ” India is taking some action on air quality. As a signatory to the Paris agreement on climate change, it is committed to ensuring that at least 40% of its electricity is generated from    sources by 2030.  In her petition, Ridhima asks the court to order the government to assess industrial projects for   issues, prepare a “carbon budget” to limit carbon dioxide emissions, and create a national climate recovery plan.  “That a young girl is doing so much to draw the government’s attention is something. We hope the case puts some pressure on the government to act,” said Choudhary.",

    "text": "Barack Obama called the adoption of clean energy in the US “irreversible” on Monday, putting pressure on his successor, Donald Trump, not to back away from a core strategy to fight climate change. Obama, penning an opinion article in the journal Science, sought to frame the argument in a way that might appeal to the  : in economic terms. He said the fact that the cost and polluting power of energy had dropped at the same time proved that fighting climate change and spurring economic growth were not mutually exclusive. “Despite the policy uncertainty that we face, I remain convinced that no country is better suited to confront the climate challenge and reap the economic benefits of a   future than the United States,” Obama wrote. He peppered his article with subtle references to Trump, noting that the debate about future climate policy was “very much on display during the current presidential transition”. As he prepares to transfer power to Trump, Obama has turned to an unusual format to make his case to Trump to preserve his policies: academic journals. In the last week, Obama also published articles under his name in the Harvard Law Review about his efforts on criminal justice reform and in the New England Journal of Medicine defending his healthcare law, which Republicans are poised to repeal. The articles reflect an effort by Obama to   the arguments Trump or Republicans are likely to employ as they work to roll back Obama’s key accomplishments in the coming years. Yet it is unclear whether Trump or the GOP could be swayed by scholarly arguments in relatively obscure publications. In Science, Obama argued that as the cost of clean energy sources like solar and wind drop, businesses are independently coming to the conclusion that it makes financial sense to wean themselves off coal and other dirtier fuels. He also said that if Trump pulls out of the global   deal struck in Paris that Obama helped broker, the US would “lose its seat at the table” on global climate policy. Obama said a key advantage of the US political system is that each president determines his or her own policies. “  Donald Trump will have the opportunity to do so,” Obama wrote. “The latest science and economics provide a helpful guide for what the future may bring. ” Meanwhile, the outgoing secretary of state, John Kerry, told students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that work to combat problems caused by climate change “should not be a partisan issue” on Monday, in one of his final speeches as the top US diplomat.  Kerry noted that military officials, intelligence leaders and mayors of coastal US cities agree that the problem of rising sea levels and erratic rainfall requires action, and urged Trump’s incoming administration to tackle such concerns head on.  Trump has described climate change as a hoax and promised to pull the US out of the deal negotiated in Paris in 2015 to cut global greenhouse gas emissions. In an interview with the New York Times in November, though, he said he was keeping an open mind on whether to pull out of the accord.  “I’m not going to speculate about the policies that our   and his secretary of state will choose to pursue,” Kerry said. Trump’s nominated successor to Kerry is Rex Tillerson, chief executive of the multinational oil giant ExxonMobil. “But I will tell you this   …     some issues look a lot different when you’re actually in office compared to when you’re on the campaign trail.  “The truth is that climate change shouldn’t be a partisan issue. It’s an issue that all of us should care about, regardless of political affiliation. ”  The Senate is due this week to begin the process of confirming Trump’s appointments, including proposed Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma who has repeatedly challenged the agency’s authority in the courts.  Many Republicans in Congress argue environmental regulations slow business growth and job creation, top priorities for the Trump administration.  Kerry referenced a US intelligence report published on Monday that listed climate change among the factors that could raise the risk of conflict between nations. Kerry called on researchers and students at MIT to keep up their work on improving energy efficiency and inventing new energy sources, regardless of government policies.  “It’s going to be innovators, researchers, entrepreneurs, and business leaders   …     who will continue to create the technological advances that forever revolutionize the way we power our world,” he said.  “Every person in this room  —   indeed, every person on the planet  —   has an interest in making sure that transition happens as quickly as possible. ” The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced on Monday that 2016 was the second hottest year in the US.",

    "text": "That was one of the final entries of a blog diary by Mark Baumer, a Rhode Island man who was walking barefoot across the United States to call attention to climate change. It was written on Day 90 of his trek, but his stream of photographs and anecdotes stopped on Jan. 21, Day 100. At 1:15 p. m. on that day, Mr. Baumer, 33, was walking on the shoulder of U. S. 90 in northern Florida when an S. U. V. left its lane and hit him, according to a Florida Highway Patrol report. He was pronounced dead at the site. The vast expanse of the United States has long been alluring to the men and women who set out on   hikes from coast to coast. Many have added to the tradition of travel literature, describing in their diaries the bouts of loneliness and moments of beauty, chronicling sleeping rough and under the stars, and writing of strangers who became friends. Mark Phillips was a graphic designer in New York City when he set off from Staten Island in March 2009, ending 4, 100 miles later in Los Angeles. “It was a way to drop out but have a set goal from beginning to end, but with an unpredictable journey in the middle,” he said in a telephone interview. But in the past few years, a few people who aimed to make the trip  —   whether for activism, adventure or escape  —   have died trying. For Joe Bell, the motivation was heartbreak. In 2013, Mr. Bell, 48, set off to walk from Oregon to New York City, where his gay teenage son, Jadin, who committed suicide after being bullied, had dreamed of working. After six months of walking, Mr. Bell was fatally struck on a road in Colorado by a   whose driver had apparently fallen asleep. In 2012, Andrew Moore, 20, was killed while walking on the median of a highway in Indiana, partway into his trek from Washington to San Francisco in support of a group that opposed abortion, The Mercury News in San Jose, Calif. reported. In 2010, Roger Grooters, 66, set out by bicycle from California to raise money for victims of the BP oil spill, and was just days away from completing his   trip when he was hit and killed by a pickup truck near Crystal Lake, Fla. The Pensacola News Journal reported. For Mr. Baumer, he had set up a crowdfunding campaign to draw attention to environmental problems and to benefit the FANG Collective, a   group that has opposed fracking. It has since raised more than $20, 000. He grew up in Maine but lived in Rhode Island, where he worked at Brown University’s library as a website specialist and was a student there, his website says. In 2010, he embarked on his first walk across the country, writing on his website about the animals that followed him, the people who fed him and the travails of   adventurers he met along the way, like the two bikers trying to get to Miami from Los Angeles for cancer research but who were halted in their tracks when a truck hit one of them. In October 2016, Mr. Baumer set out on his latest   hike, with financial help from a poetry fellowship he had been given from the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts. On Oct. 13, he published a video on his YouTube page as he set out on his journey with a barefoot run from Providence to Coventry. His diary took followers through Connecticut, the Bronx, Times Square and Pennsylvania. People offered him shoes, or a lift. In one encounter in Pennsylvania, he was asked if he was “one of those mountain people. ” He was on the road during the presidential election, and Mr. Baumer’s messages took on a political hue. “Since I began crossing America barefoot, I’ve seen more Trump signs than Hillary signs,” he wrote, referring to Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton. “I thought maybe I was walking through politically fringe areas or outlier territories, but last night as I sat scrolling through the news of Trump’s election on my phone, I had the weird feeling of being ignorant of how this was happening but also truly comprehending America for the first time. ” In December, he took a break from his walk down Interstate 70 and had an interview with Vice News, saying that he expected to finish his trek in March and that the best place to walk was along the white line of a road because it was smooth. “I’m constantly fighting for my space in the road,” he said. “A lot of [drivers] are like, ‘How dare you? !’” On his 98th day, in Florida, he encountered bicycle riders who were also on a   trip. They told him, he said, “We’ve met some of the worst people ever on this trip, but the landscapes are beautiful. ” On the 100th day, Mr. Baumer walked from Defuniak Springs to Mossy Head. He took a photograph of himself standing with his toes near the   word “killed” on the road, with an arrow pointing ahead. The image captured a gas line connection on a grassy lawn, and it was the last one on his blog. He sat on a bench in the rain and spoke to his father. Among the thoughts he wrote: “I spent most of the morning looking at my phone and wondering if any of the thoughts inside of it would survive. ” Lt. Eddie W. Elmore of the Florida Highway Patrol said that Mr. Baumer’s death was still under investigation. The police report said only that the driver, a    woman from Florida who had a child in the car, had “failed to maintain her lane” and entered the shoulder, striking Mr. Baumer. Mr. Baumer’s father, Jim, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that the family was planning to set a date for a “celebration of his life” in Providence, where his son had “touched so many people,” from fellow students at Brown University, from which he graduated in 2011, to people at the farmers’ market. “We have received such an outpouring of love at a very dark and difficult period of time,” he said. Ada Smailbegovic, his girlfriend, was on a trip to Canada when she last heard from him in a brief text message. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, she said: “He wanted to have a real confrontation with the elements of the world with his body. He was moving between those two spaces. ”",

    "text": "WASHINGTON  —   The White House is fiercely divided over President Trump’s campaign promise to “cancel” the Paris agreement, the 2015 accord that binds nearly every country to curb global warming, with more moderate voices maintaining that he should stick with the agreement despite his campaign pledge. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s senior adviser, is pressing the president to officially pull the United States from the landmark accord, according to energy and government officials with knowledge of the debate. But, they say, he is clashing with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, who fear the move could have broad and damaging diplomatic ramifications. Mr. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to tear up President Barack Obama’s global warming policies, and on the home front he is moving aggressively to meet those pledges with deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and a new E. P. A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, who is a skeptic of climate science. Next week, Mr. Trump plans to sign an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to start the lengthy legal process of unwinding Mr. Obama’s E. P. A. regulations for cutting greenhouse pollution from   power plants. Those regulations are the linchpin of the last administration’s program to meet the nation’s obligations to reduce climate emissions under the Paris agreement. While the president cannot, as Mr. Trump suggested, unilaterally undo a   accord that has already been legally ratified, he could initiate the   process to withdraw the world’s largest economy and   climate polluter from the first worldwide deal to tackle global warming. Such a move would rend a global deal that has been hailed as historic, throwing into question the fate of global climate policy and, diplomats say, the credibility of the United States. But it would also demonstrate to his supporters that Mr. Trump is a man of his word, putting American coal interests ahead of a global deal forged by Mr. Obama. On one side of that debate is Mr. Bannon, who as a former chief executive of Breitbart News published countless articles denouncing climate change as a hoax, and who has vowed to push Mr. Trump to transform all his major campaign promises into policy actions. On the other side are Ms. Trump, Mr. Tillerson, and a slew of foreign policy advisers and career diplomats who argue that the fallout of withdrawing from the accord could be severe, undercutting the United States’ credibility on other foreign policy issues and damaging relations with key allies. Although Ms. Trump has not spoken out publicly for action to combat climate change, proponents and opponents of such action see her as an ally. Former Vice President Al Gore met with her during the Trump transition, and was ushered in by the “first daughter” to see the  . The actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio even slipped her a DVD copy of his   documentary. “President Trump Must Not Wobble on Climate Change  —   No Matter What Ivanka Says   …   ” blared a Breitbart post on Monday written by James Delingpole, who is close to Mr. Bannon and who leads the website’s coverage of   policy. Mr. Trump wants to make a decision by next week, say people familiar with the White House’s debate on the climate pact, in order to announce his executive order to undo Mr. Obama’s climate regulations in conjunction with his plans for the Paris deal. According to leaked budget documents, the president will also propose killing off nearly two dozen E. P. A. programs, including the   Clean Power Program, climate partnership programs with local governments, Energy Star grants to encourage efficiency research in consumer products and   research. Those would be part of a broader budget submission that would cut the E. P. A. ’s funding by 25 percent, to around $6. 1 billion from $8. 2 billion, and its staff by 20 percent. “If the goal is to fulfill the president’s campaign promises and implement his agenda, there is no value in staying in Paris,” said Thomas J. Pyle, an adviser to the Trump transition and the president of the Institute for Energy Research, an organization partly funded by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, who have worked for years to undermine   policies. Mr. Trump has cited Mr. Pyle’s group as being influential in shaping his energy and climate proposals, including his campaign pledge to withdraw from the Paris deal. “The two greatest obstacles to a Clexit (climate exit from U. N. Paris agreement) are probably Ivanka and Tillerson,” wrote Marc Morano, a former Republican Senate staff member who now runs Climate Depot, a     website that promotes the denial of climate science, in an email. “Tillerson with his ‘seat at the table’ views could be biggest proponent of not withdrawing the U. S. from the agreement. ” Mr. Tillerson is a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, which, like many major global corporations, endorsed the Paris agreement. While his former company once denied   climate change, it has more recently publicly acknowledged the threat posed by burning oil and supported proposals to tax carbon dioxide pollution. Asked during his Senate confirmation hearing about the Paris accord, Mr. Tillerson said, “It’s important that the U. S. maintains its seat at the table about how to address the threat of climate change, which does require a global response. ” Under the Paris agreement, every nation has formally submitted plans detailing how it expects to lower its   pollution. The Obama administration pledged that the United States would reduce its carbon pollution about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. However, that pledge depends on enactment of Mr. Obama’s E. P. A. regulations on   power plants, which Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt intend to substantially weaken or eliminate. But under the Paris deal, those numerical targets are not legally binding, and there are no sanctions for failing to meet them. The primary legal requirements of the deal are that countries publicly put forth their emissions reductions targets, and later put forth reports verifying how they are meeting the targets. It would be possible for the Trump administration to stay in the deal and submit a less ambitious target. Even senior Republican voices in the foreign policy debate have said it may be wiser to stay in but keep a low profile. “There’s really no obligation,” Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview. “It doesn’t require us to do anything. I think they may take a little time to assess whether pulling out makes sense now. ” Foreign policy experts say withdrawing from Paris would have far greater diplomatic consequences than President George W. Bush’s withdrawal from the world’s first global   accord, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. “I think it would be a major mistake, even a historic mistake, to disavow the Paris deal,” said R. Nicholas Burns, a retired career diplomat and under secretary of state under Mr. Bush. “In international politics, trust, reliability and keeping your commitments  —   that’s a big part of how other countries view our country,” Mr. Burns said. “I can’t think of an issue, except perhaps NATO, where if the U. S. simply walks away, it would have such a major negative impact on how we are seen. ” The Paris deal is more consequential than Kyoto. Unlike that pact, which required action only from developed economies, the Paris agreement includes commitments from every nation, rich and poor, to cut emissions, including China and India, the world’s largest and   polluters. Also, the science of climate change has become far more certain and the impact more visible in the 20 years since Kyoto. Each of the last three years has surpassed the previous one as the hottest on record. Some of the United States’ closest allies are urging the Trump administration not to pull out. In a letter to Mr. Trump after he won the election, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany wrote, “Partnership with the United States is and will remain a keystone of German foreign policy, especially so that we can tackle the great challenges of our time. ” They include, she wrote, “working to develop farsighted climate policy. ” As Mr. Trump and his advisers weigh their Paris options, one proposal is gaining traction, according to participants in the debate: Mr. Trump could declare that the Paris agreement is a treaty that requires ratification by the Senate. The pact was designed not to have the legal force of a treaty specifically so that it would not have to go before the United States Senate, which would have assuredly failed to ratify it. “If there are camps forming in the White House, then let the people decide, the elected representatives,” Mr. Pyle said. “Let’s put the question to them. ” Proponents of that idea say it could shift some of the weight of the decision from Mr. Trump to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, at least in the eyes of some foreign diplomats, and of the president’s daughter.",

    "text": "British Prime Minister Theresa May used her speech in Philadelphia today to warn over climate change, call Islam a religion of peace, and hail globalist institutions such as the World Bank and United Nations. [The full text of the speech follows:     Majority Leader McConnell, Mr Speaker, Distinguished Members of the Senate and Representatives of the House. I would like to thank Congress and the Congressional Institute for the invitation to be here today. The opportunity to visit the United States is always special. And to be invited to be the first serving Head of Government to address this important conference is an honour indeed. I defy any person to travel to this great country at any time and not to be inspired by its promise and its example. For more than two centuries, the very idea of America  —   drawn from history and given written form in a small hall not far from here  —   has lit up the world. That idea  —   that all are created equal and that all are born free  —   has never been surpassed in the long history of political thought. And it is here  —   on the streets and in the halls of this great city of Philadelphia  —   that the founding fathers first set it down, that the textbook of freedom was written, and that this great nation that grew “from sea to shining sea” was born. Since that day, it has been America’s destiny to bear the leadership of the free world and to carry that heavy responsibility on its shoulders. But my country, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, has been proud to share that burden and to walk alongside you at every stage. For the past century, Britain and America  —   and the unique and special relationship that exists between us  —   have taken the idea conceived by those “     ordinary citizens” as President Reagan called them, forward. And because we have done so, time and again it is the relationship between us that has defined the modern world. One hundred years ago this April, it was your intervention in the First World War that helped Britain, France, our friends in the Commonwealth and other allies to maintain freedom in Europe. A little more than   years ago, you responded to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour by joining Britain in the Second World War and defeating fascism not just in the Pacific but in Africa and Europe too. And later, in the aftermath of these wars, our two countries led the West through the Cold War, confronting communism and ultimately defeating it not just through military might, but by winning the war of ideas. And by proving that open, liberal, democratic societies will always defeat those that are closed, coercive and cruel. But the leadership provided by our two countries through the Special Relationship has done more than win wars and overcome adversity. It made the modern world. The institutions upon which that world relies were so often conceived or inspired by our two nations working together. The United Nations  —   in need of reform, but vital still  —   has its foundations in the Special Relationship, from the original Declaration of St James’ Palace to the Declaration by United Nations, signed in Washington, and drafted themselves by Winston Churchill and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund, born in the   world at Bretton Woods, were conceived by our two nations working together. And NATO  —   the cornerstone of the West’s defence  —   was established on the bonds of trust and mutual interests that exist between us. Some of these organisations are in need of reform and renewal to make them relevant to our needs today. But we should be proud of the role our two nations  —   working in partnership  —   played in bringing them into being, and in bringing peace and prosperity to billions of people as a result. Because it is through our actions over many years, working together to defeat evil or to open up the world, that we have been able to fulfil the promise of those who first spoke of the special nature of the relationship between us. The promise of freedom, liberty and the rights of man. “We must never cease” Churchill said, “to proclaim in fearless tones the great principles of freedom and the rights of man which are the joint inheritance of the   world and which through Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Habeas Corpus, trial by jury, and the English common law, find their most famous expression in the American Declaration of Independence”. So it is my honour and my privilege to stand before you today in this great city of Philadelphia to proclaim them again, to join hands as we pick up that mantle of leadership once more, to renew our Special Relationship and to recommit ourselves to the responsibility of leadership in the modern world. CHANGE IN AMERICA, And it is my honour and privilege to do so at this time, as dawn breaks on a new era of American renewal. For I speak to you not just as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but as a fellow Conservative who believes in the same principles that underpin the agenda of your Party. The value of liberty. The dignity of work. The principles of nationhood, family, economic prudence, patriotism  —   and putting power in the hands of the people. Principles instilled in me from a young age. Principles that my parents taught me in the vicarage in Southern England in which I was raised. I know that it is these principles that you have put at the heart of your plan for government. And your victory in these elections gives you the opportunity to put them at the heart of this new era of American renewal too. President Trump’s victory  —   achieved in defiance of all the pundits and the polls  —   and rooted not in the corridors of Washington, but in the hopes and aspirations of working men and women across this land. Your Party’s victory in both the Congress and the Senate where you swept all before you, secured with great effort, and achieved with an important message of national renewal. And because of this  —   because of what you have done together, because of that great victory you have won  —   America can be stronger, greater, and more confident in the years ahead. CHANGE IN BRITAIN, And a newly emboldened, confident America is good for the world. An America that is strong and prosperous at home is a nation that can lead abroad. But you cannot  —   and should not  —   do so alone. You have said that it is time for others to step up. And I agree. Sovereign countries cannot outsource their security and prosperity to America. And they should not undermine the alliances that keep us strong by failing to step up and play their part. This is something Britain has always understood. It is why Britain is the only country in the G20  —   other than yours  —   to meet its commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence, and to invest 20% of that in upgrading equipment. It is why Britain is the only country in the G20 to spend 0. 7% of gross national income on overseas development. It is why my first act as Prime Minister last year was to lead the debate in Parliament that ensured the renewal of Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent. And it is why the Government I lead will increase spending on defence in every year of this Parliament. It is why Britain is a leading member  —   alongside the United States  —   of the coalition working successfully to defeat Daesh why we have agreed to send 800 troops to Estonia and Poland as part of NATO’s forward presence in eastern Europe why we are increasing our troop contribution to NATO’s Resolute Support mission that defends the Afghan government from terrorism and it is why we are reinforcing our commitment to peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, South Sudan and Somalia. And it is why Britain is leading the way in pioneering international efforts to crack down on modern slavery  —   one of the great scourges of our world  —   wherever it is found. I hope you will join us in that cause  —   and I commend Senator Corker in particular for his work in this field. It is good to see him here today. As Americans know, the United Kingdom is by instinct and history a great, global nation that recognises its responsibilities to the world. And as we end our membership of the European Union  —   as the British people voted with determination and quiet resolve to do last year  —   we have the opportunity to reassert our belief in a confident, sovereign and Global Britain, ready to build relationships with old friends and new allies alike. We will build a new partnership with our friends in Europe. We are not turning our back on them, or on the interests and the values that we share. It remains overwhelmingly in our interests  —   and in those of the wider world  —   that the EU should succeed. And for as long as we remain members we will continue to play our full part, just as we will continue to cooperate on security, foreign policy and trade once we have left. But we have chosen a different future for our country. A future that sees us restore our parliamentary sovereignty and national   and to become even more global and internationalist in action and in spirit. A future that sees us take back control of the things that matter to us  —   things like our national borders and immigration policy, and the way we decide and interpret our own laws  —   so that we are able to shape a better, more prosperous future for the working men and women of Britain. A future that sees us step up with confidence to a new, even more internationalist role, where we meet our responsibilities to our friends and allies, champion the international cooperation and partnerships that project our values around the world, and continue to act as one of the strongest and most forceful advocates for business, free markets and free trade anywhere around the globe. This is a vision of a future that my country can unite around  —   and that I hope your country, as our closest friend and ally, can welcome and support. A RENEWED SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP, So as we rediscover our confidence together  —   as you renew your nation just as we renew ours  —   we have the opportunity  —   indeed the responsibility  —   to renew the Special Relationship for this new age. We have the opportunity to lead, together, again. Because the world is passing through a period of change  —   and in response to that change we can either be passive bystanders, or we can take the opportunity once more to lead. And to lead together. I believe it is in our national interest to do so. Because the world is increasingly marked by instability and threats that threaten to undermine our way of life and the very things that we hold dear. The end of the Cold War did not give rise to a New World Order. It did not herald the End of History. It did not lead to a new age of peace, prosperity and predictability in world affairs. For some  —   the citizens of Central and Eastern Europe in particular  —   it brought new freedom. But across the world, ancient ethnic, religious and national rivalries  —   rivalries that had been frozen through the decades of the Cold War  —   returned. New enemies of the West and our values  —   in particular in the form of Radical Islamists  —   have emerged. And countries with little tradition of democracy, liberty and human rights  —   notably China and Russia  —   have grown more assertive in world affairs. The rise of the Asian economies  —   China yes, but democratic allies like India too  —   is hugely welcome. Billions are being lifted out of poverty and new markets for our industries are opening up. But these events  —   coming as they have at the same time as the financial crisis and its fall out, as well as a loss of confidence in the West following   the military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and sporadic terrorist attacks  —   have led many to fear that, in this century, we will experience the eclipse of the West. But there is nothing inevitable about that. Other countries may grow stronger. Big, populous countries may grow richer. And as they do so, they may start to embrace more fully our values of democracy and liberty. But even if they do not, our interests will remain. Our values will endure. And the need to defend them and project them will be as important as ever. So we  —   our two countries together  —   have a joint responsibility to lead. Because when others step up as we step back, it is bad for America, for Britain and the world. It is in our interests  —   those of Britain and America together  —   to stand strong together to defend our values, our interests and the very ideas in which we believe. This cannot mean a return to the failed policies of the past. The days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over. But nor can we afford to stand idly by when the threat is real and when it is in our own interests to intervene. We must be strong, smart and  . And we must demonstrate the resolve necessary to stand up for our interests. And whether it is the security of Israel in the Middle East or Estonia in the Baltic states, we must always stand up for our friends and allies in democratic countries that find themselves in tough neighbourhoods too. We each have different political traditions. We will sometimes pursue different domestic policies. And there may be occasions on which we disagree. But the common values and interests that bring us together are hugely powerful. And  —   as your foremost friend and ally  —   we support many of the priorities your government has laid out for America’s engagement with the world. It is why I join you in your determination to take on and defeat Daesh and the ideology of Islamic extremism that inspires them and many others terrorist groups in the world today. It is in both of our national interests to do so. This will require us to use the intelligence provided by the finest security agencies in the world. And it will require the use of military might. But it also demands a wider effort. Because one of the lessons of fighting terrorism in the last 15 years or so is yes, killing terrorists can save innocent lives. But until we kill the idea that drives them, the ideology, we will always have to live with this threat. And as they are defeated on the ground, the terrorists are exploiting the internet and social media to spread this ideology that is preying on vulnerable citizens in our own countries, inspiring them to commit acts of terror in our own cities. That is why the UK has led the world in developing a strategy for preventing violent extremism, and why the British and American governments are working together to take on and defeat the ideology of Islamist Extremism. I look forward to working with the President and his Administration to step up our efforts still further in order to defeat this evil ideology. But of course, we should always be careful to distinguish between this extreme and hateful ideology, and the peaceful religion of Islam and the hundreds of millions of its adherents  —   including millions of our own citizens and those further afield who are so often the first victims of this ideology’s terror. And nor is it enough merely to focus on violent extremism. We need to address the whole spectrum of extremism, starting with the bigotry and hatred that can so often turn to violence. Yet ultimately to defeat Daesh, we must employ all of the diplomatic means at our disposal. That means working internationally to secure a political solution in Syria and challenging the alliance between the Syrian regime and its backers in Tehran. When it comes to Russia, as so often it is wise to turn to the example of President Reagan who  —   during negotiations with his opposite number Mikhail Gorbachev  —   used to abide by the adage “trust but verify”. With President Putin, my advice is to “engage but beware”. There is nothing inevitable about conflict between Russia and the West. And nothing unavoidable about retreating to the days of the Cold War. But we should engage with Russia from a position of strength. And we should build the relationships, systems and processes that make cooperation more likely than conflict  —   and that, particularly after the illegal annexation of Crimea, give assurance to Russia’s neighbouring states that their security is not in question. We should not jeopardise the freedoms that President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher brought to Eastern Europe by accepting President Putin’s claim that it is now in his sphere of influence. And progress on this issue would also help to secure another of this nation’s priorities  —   to reduce Iran’s malign influence in the Middle East. This is a priority for the UK too as we support our allies in the Gulf States to push back against Iran’s aggressive efforts to build an arc of influence from Tehran through to the Mediterranean. The nuclear deal with Iran was controversial. But it has neutralised the possibility of the Iranians acquiring nuclear weapons for more than a decade. It has seen Iran remove 13, 000 centrifuges together with associated infrastructure and eliminate its stock of 20% enriched uranium. That was vitally important for regional security. But the agreement must now be very carefully and rigorously policed  —   and any breaches should be dealt with firmly and immediately. STRONG INSTITUTIONS AND NATIONS, To deal with the threats of the modern world, we need to rebuild confidence in the institutions upon which we all rely. In part that means multinational institutions. Because we know that so many of the threats we face today  —   global terrorism, climate change, and unprecedented mass movements of people  —   do not respect national borders. So we must turn towards those multinational institutions like the UN and NATO that encourage international cooperation and partnership. But those multinational institutions need to work for the countries that formed them, and to serve the needs and interests of the people of those nations. They have no democratic mandate of their own. So I share your reform agenda and believe that, by working together, we can make those institutions more relevant and purposeful than they are today. I call on others, therefore, to join us in that effort and to ensure they step up and contribute as they should. That is why I have encouraged Antonio Guterres, the new UN Secretary General, to pursue an ambitious reform programme, focusing the United Nations on its core functions of peacekeeping, conflict prevention and resolution. And it is why I have already raised with my fellow European leaders the need to deliver on their commitments to spend 2% of their GDP on defence  —   and 20% of their defence budgets on equipment. It is also why I have already raised with Jens Stoltenberg  —   the Secretary General of NATO  —   the need to make sure the Alliance is as equipped to fight terrorism and cyber warfare, as it is to fight more conventional forms of war. America’s leadership role in NATO  —   supported by Britain  —   must be the central element around which the Alliance is built. But alongside this continued commitment, I am also clear that EU nations must similarly step up to ensure this institution that provides the cornerstone of the West’s defence continues to be as effective as it can be. Yet the most important institution is  —   and should always be  —   the nation state. Strong nations form strong institutions. And they form the basis of the international partnerships and cooperation that bring stability to our world. Nations, accountable to their populations  —   “deriving” as the Declaration of Independence puts it “their just powers from the consent of the governed”  —   can choose to join international organisations, or not. They can choose to cooperate with others, or not. Choose to trade with others, or not. Which is why if the countries of the European Union wish to integrate further, my view is that they should be free to do so. Because that is what they choose. But Britain  —   as a sovereign nation with the same values but a different political and cultural history  —   has chosen to take a different path. Because our history and culture is profoundly internationalist. We are a European country  —   and proud of our shared European heritage  —   but we are also a country that has always looked beyond Europe to the wider world. We have ties of family, kinship and history to countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and countries across Africa, the Pacific and Caribbean. And of course, we have ties of kinship, language and culture to these United States too. As Churchill put it, we “speak the same language, kneel at the same altars and, to a very large extent, pursue the same ideals”. And, today, increasingly we have strong economic, commercial, defence and political relationships as well. So I am delighted that the new Administration has made a trade agreement between our countries one of its earliest priorities. A new trade deal between Britain and America must work for both sides and serve both of our national interests. It must help to grow our respective economies and to provide the     jobs of the future for working people across America and across the UK. And it must work for those who have too often felt left behind by the forces of globalisation. People, often those on modest incomes living in relatively rich countries like our own, who feel that the global system of free markets and free trade is simply not working for them in its current form. Such a deal  —   allied to the reforms we are making to our own economy to ensure wealth and opportunity is spread across our land  —   can demonstrate to those who feel locked out and left behind that free markets, free economies and free trade can deliver the brighter future they need. And it can maintain  —   indeed it can build  —   support for the   international system on which the stability of our world continues to rely. The UK is already America’s fifth largest export destination, while your markets account for almost a fifth of global exports from our shores. Exports to the UK from this State of Pennsylvania alone account for more than $2 billion a year. The UK is the largest market in the EU  —   and the third largest market in the world  —   for exporters here. America is the largest single destination for UK outward investment and the single largest investor in the UK. And your companies are investing or expanding in the UK at a rate of more than ten projects a week. British companies employ people in every US state from Texas to Vermont. And the   Defence relationship is the broadest, deepest and most advanced of any two countries, sharing military hardware and expertise. And of course, we have recently invested in the new   strike aircraft for our new aircraft carriers that will secure our naval presence  —   and increase our ability to project our power around the world  —   for years to come. Because of these strong economic and commercial links  —   and our shared history and the strength of our relationship  —   I look forward to pursuing talks with the new Administration about a new   Free Trade Agreement in the coming months. It will take detailed work, but we welcome your openness to those discussions and hope we can make progress so that the new, Global Britain that emerges after Brexit is even better equipped to take its place confidently in the world. CONCLUSION, Such an agreement would see us taking that next step in the special relationship that exists between us. Cementing and affirming one of the greatest forces for progress this world has ever known. Seventy years ago in 1946, Churchill proposed a new phase in this relationship  —   to win a Cold War that many had not even realised had started. He described how an iron curtain had fallen from the Baltic to the Adriatic, covering all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe: Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Sofia and Bucharest. Today those great cities  —   homes of great culture and heritage  —   live in freedom and peace. And they do so because of the leadership of Britain and America, and of Mrs Thatcher and President Reagan. They do so  —   ultimately  —   because our ideas will always prevail. And they do so because, when the world demands leadership, it is this alliance of values and interests  —   this Special Relationship between two countries  —   that, to borrow the words of another great American statesman, enters the arena, with our faces marred by dust and sweat and blood, to strive valiantly and know the triumph of high achievement. As we renew the promise of our nations to make them stronger at home  —   in the words of President Reagan as the “sleeping giant stirs”  —   so let us renew the relationship that can lead the world towards the promise of freedom and prosperity marked out in parchment by those ordinary citizens 240 years ago. So that we may not be counted with the “cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat” but with those who “strive to do the deeds” that will lead us to a better world. That better future is within reach. Together, we can build it.",

[Obama criticized Trump’s decision as “an absence of American leadership” that moved the United States backward.  “Even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future I’m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we’ve got,” he wrote in a statement. Obama recalled his “steady, principled” leadership on the climate change agreement and “bold American ambition” that convinced other countries to follow their lead. “The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created,” he said. Obama praised business interests for investing in green energy, but did not mention the government subsidies that made it possible. Despite his assertion that he wanted to remain silent after leaving office, Obama has broken that promise on multiple occasions to criticize President Trump.",

    "text": "As retailer Target sees its stock plummeting and sales dropping in the midst of a boycott over its recently announced   bathroom policy, the company’s CEO is insisting the weather is the cause of falling sales, not the company’s bathroom policy. [In a recent Wall Street Journal interview, Target CEO Brian Cornell pegged the downturn in the company’s fortunes to the cold weather as opposed to anything the company itself is doing or not doing.  “It’s been a very wet and cold start to the year and it’s reflected in our sales,” Cornell told the paper. “We haven’t seen anything from a structural standpoint that gives us pause. ” In other words, the weather is responsible for the downturn, not Target’s  “structural” transgender bathroom policy. Indeed, a month after the initial announcement, the Target CEO came out to double down on the transgender agenda, so it appears the company is digging in heels instead of looking for ways at appeal to customers. Still, Cornell’s weather assessment does not quite tally with other reports stating Target has taken a major hit since it announced its transgender policy. Granted, most retailers have been down over the first quarter and the start of the second quarter this year. But Target has been on a downward trend exceeding the fall of its competitors. Target, for instance, says it will post a $1 to a $1. 20 adjusted earnings per share, which is well below the $1. 38 analysts expected. Further, at 1. 2 percent, the company’s sales are below the 1. 5 to 2. 5 percent annual target it had hoped to realize. With the tumble, Target warned that its sales might be flat by the end of the second quarter. A closer examination, however, shows that sales and the company’s reputation have taken a particular hit since its April 19   bathroom announcement, a decision that sponsored a major boycott movement that earned 1. 2 million supporters in only a week’s time. A recent Business Insider article noted that Target’s reputation has tumbled six points among consumers in the last several months. In the months prior to the bathroom policy announcement, 42 percent of consumers said they would shop at the department store chain. But in the month following the bathroom policy announcement, the number dropped to 36 percent. The reports also found that consumer perception of the Target brand is at its lowest in two years. Whatever the cause of the drop, since April 19, Target has lost nearly $6 billion in stock values. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",

[Live event movie company Fathom Events is teaming with SpectiCast to present Climate Hustle in nearly 400 theaters on May 2, according to Variety. The film, from director Christopher Rogers (Where the Grass is Greener) “tears the cover off of global warming hype and shows what’s really behind this   dollar scam. ”  Palin will reportedly appear at a panel discussion in Washington following the screening of the film, alongside Rep. Lamar Smith ( ) chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, as well as Media Research Center founder Brent Bozell and Bill Nye the Science Guy. WATCH: In a statement to Variety, Palin said she is “very passionate” about the issue of climate change, and said the film “presents strong arguments” against the theory of   global warming “in a very relatable way. ” “People who do not believe in American exceptionalism have made this into a campaign issue, so it’s vital that the other side be heard,” Palin told the outlet. “I’m very pleased that this is written and spoken in layman’s terms. My dad taught science to fifth and sixth graders and it was very important to him that science be presented in an understandable way. ” Climate Hustle is hosted and narrated by Marc Morano, founder of ClimateDepot. com. The film reportedly includes interviews with prominent scientists and climate researchers, including Georgia Tech climatologist Dr. Judith Curry and former NASA scientist Dr. John Theon. “This film is truly unique among climate documentaries,” Morano told Variety. “Climate Hustle presents viewers with facts and compelling video footage going back four decades, and delivers a powerful presentation of dissenting science, best of all, in a humorous way.

    "text": "Every year the UN runs a poll which surveys people’s greatest concerns across the world. [It’s significant because the responses run into the millions and canvas the views of people from all countries, rich and poor.  So guess where ‘climate change’ comes on the global population’s list of priorities. Yes, that’s right. It comes right at the bottom.  More than three times as many people care about education, and well over twice as many want better healthcare, job opportunities, and honest government than want “action taken on climate change”. Only when the surveys are broken down between rich and poor countries does “climate change” creep higher up the list. But only in rich countries. In poor countries, as a ratio of the total number of votes made, it becomes even less of a concern.  “Action on climate change” in other words, is the decadent preoccupation of spoilt Westerners who have nothing serious to worry about because they have all the basics  —   education, healthcare, jobs, political freedoms, phone and internet access  —   more or less covered. The poll gives the lie to all those people  —   usual of a   persuasion  —   who insist that more needs to be done, more scarce resources diverted, to ‘combat’ climate change. If the money currently squandered by our governments on this    —   $1. 5 trillion a year  —   reflected people’s actual concerns (as governments are supposed to do) then the funding would dry up and a lot of worthless troughers would suddenly find themselves going very hungry. Which would be good for them, in a way, because for the first time in their miserable parasitical lives they might get a sense of the harm their policies are inflicting around the world  —   most especially on the poor who, more than anyone, need the cheap fossil fuel energy the greenies are determined to deny them.",

    "text": "National Geographic released the first trailer for Leonardo DiCaprio’s climate change documentary Before the Flood on Tuesday. [The   clip follows the   Revenant actor as he travels the world to learn about and advocate for an end to   global warming. On the journey, the actor meets dignitaries and business leaders including President Obama, Pope Francis, John Kerry and Elon Musk in an attempt to learn more about what can be done to save the planet from the effects of climate change.   The film, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this month, is set to be screened on the White House’s South Lawn on October 3 as part of the inaugural South by South Lawn (SXSL) arts festival. Before the screening, DiCaprio will meet with President Obama and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe for a conversation focusing on ways to end climate change. Before the Flood is directed by Fisher Stevens, who won an Oscar for his 2009 documentary The Cove. In an interview with Variety at the Toronto Film Festival, Stevens said the project had gotten off the ground when DiCaprio called him and expressed interest in making a climate change documentary, and added that the actor was the perfect ambassador to carry the film’s message. “He was made the Messenger of Peace for climate change by the U. N. so we kind of used that as our   for the movie,” Stevens said of DiCaprio’s involvement. “Leo’s an amazing voice. He looks great. He knows a lot. I was shocked at how much Leo knew about the subject before we even started filming. ” The release of Before the Flood comes as DiCaprio has faced increased scrutiny over his environmental foundation’s reported connections to wealthy donors involved in a $3 billion Malaysian embezzlement scheme. Environmental activist groups have called on the actor to return some donations alleged to have been funded with money misappropriated from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund.

    "text": "A charity focused on rainforest preservation has called on actor and environmental advocate Leonardo DiCaprio to step down from his role as a UN Messenger of Peace for climate change due to his own charity’s reported connection to a $3 billion Malaysian embezzlement scheme. [The Bruno Manser Funds  —   which in August urged the actor and his Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation to return what it called “stolen money”  —   repeated its demand at a press conference in London on Friday, according to the Hollywood Reporter.  “If DiCaprio is unwilling to come clean, we ask him to step down as UN Messenger of Peace for climate change, because he simply lacks the credibility for such an important role,” Bruno Manser Funds director Lukas Straumann said, according to THR. The calls for DiCaprio to resign from his position at the United Nations, which was bestowed upon him in 2014, stem from the actor’s reported connection to several figures embroiled in the world’s largest embezzlement scheme. According to a Department of Justice complaint, the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street  —   for which DiCaprio won a Golden Globe  —   was funded with $238 million stolen from 1MDB, a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund holding billions of dollars earmarked for development in the country. Red Granite Pictures, which produced the film, was founded by the stepson of the Malaysian prime minister, Riza Aziz, now a central figure in the investigation into the mismanagement of the 1MDB fund. The complaint also alleges that DiCaprio’s   charity organization received donations or benefitted from auction items purchased with money stolen from the Malaysian fund. The actor’s charity has faced increasing pressure to return what some have called its “ ” donations. In an open letter to the charity last month, Malaysian attorney and civil rights advocate Ambiga Sreenevasan expressed “shock” and “embarrassment” to learn that the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation was, as she put it, “connected with the heist of the decade that has undermined the [Malaysian] people in so many ways. ”   environmental organization Save Rivers has also called on the actor to return questionable donations. The increased pressure comes as DiCaprio is on a tour of film festivals around the world to unveil his National Geographic climate change documentary Before the Flood. The actor was reportedly in London on Saturday for the film’s premiere at the BFI London Film Festival, and previously premiered the film at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. Earlier this month, the actor joined President Obama and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe for a discussion about climate change at the White House, which was followed by a screening of his film on the White House’s South Lawn.

    "text": "Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has stated he will not abide by the Paris Agreement, an international climate change pact, calling the deal “stupid” and “absurd,” and accusing developed countries of “imposing” on less wealthy states after having committed their own share of environmental atrocities. [Duterte was addressing the Philippine Olympic team at the presidential palace in Manila, sending them off to Rio de Janeiro to compete in next month’s games. He told an anecdote of an unnamed ambassador questioning whether the Philippines will be able to keep its carbon emissions low as per the climate change pact signed in December. The question, Duterte admitted, made him want “to kick him. ”  “I said, ‘No. I cannot tell.   …     You don’t do it that way, Mr. Ambassador. [Your country] had reached the apex [of industrialization] and along the way put a lot of contaminants and emission and went ahead in destroying the climate,’” Duterte said he responded to the ambassador. “We have not reached the age of industrialization. We’re now going into it. But you are trying [to] stymie (our growth) with an agreement that says you can only go up to here,” he added, calling abiding by climate pacts “stupid. ” “Kalokohan yan [That’s absurd],” he continued, “So that is how very competitive and that is how very constricted our lives [are] now. It’s being controlled by the world. It’s being imposed upon us by the industrialized countries. They think that they can dictate the destiny of the rest of the nation. ” “I will not honor that,” he concluded. As to whether the Paris Agreement is binding, as the Philippines signed the deal before Duterte took office, he asserted, “That’s not my signature. ” The Philippine Star notes that Duterte had previously said he would abide by the Paris deal, but only if developed countries paid for the Philippines to buy the technology necessary to cut emissions. “They were enjoying the booming [economy] and flooding the air with contaminants. Now that they are rich because of coal and industrialization, we are being asked to cut emission and limit our activities,” he declared. Environmentalists urged Duterte to engage in a dialogue with them. “Climate change is a complex political issue that requires reflection from the point of view of climate justice. As such, since climate change was largely caused by rich countries, fairness dictates that they shall have a larger share of the responsibility in solving the problem,” Naderev “Yeb” Saño, a climate change activist, told the Philippine outlet Rappler. “We are willing to sit down with him to discuss the comprehensiveness of the Philippine position and the Paris agreement,” Rodne Galicha, another activist representing the Climate Reality Project Philippines, said. Rappler notes that “highly industrialized countries like China, the United States, Japan, India and other   Gulf nations account for almost 70% of the greenhouse gas emissions in 2011. ” The refusal to abide by international climate change regulations comes for Duterte at a time of high tension between the Philippines and its closest developed neighbor, China. Last week, the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague rejected Chinese claims to the South China Sea consisting largely of Philippine territory. China has refused to abide by the verdict, calling it an imposition from Japan and the United States, neither of which had a role in the trial. During its illegal occupation of the South China Sea, China has destroyed at least 17 reefs, constructing artificial islands to be used as military assets. Philippine activists have also found evidence of China’s dumping chemicals into South China Sea fishing grounds traditionally frequented by Filipino fishermen so as to deter them from being present in sovereign Philippine territory. The Chinese government, through the propaganda outlet The Global Times, vowed to protect the environmental integrity of the disputed territory in the region in May. “Once China’s construction activities are complete, ecological environmental protection on relevant islands and reefs will be notably enhanced and such action will stand the test of time,” an official vowed.",

    "text": "Leonardo DiCaprio told Charlie Rose in an interview Thursday that climate change is “the biggest problem that mankind has ever had to face,” ahead of the international refugee crises being fueled by the deadly rise of the Islamic State. [“It is the most existential human crisis that the world has ever known, in my opinion,” DiCaprio said.  Fresh from filming The Revenant, DiCaprio and the film’s director Alejandro Iñárritu recounted how they experienced the devastating affects of climate change on location in Argentina in the nine months that it took to make the movie.  DiCaprio’s comments in the video above echo similar statements he made last December when he claimed that “We were in Calgary and the locals were saying, ‘This has never happened in our province, ever.’ We would come and there would be eight feet of snow, and then all of a sudden a warm gust of wind would come. ” But as Breitbart’s James Delingpole reported, the supposedly unprecedented weather events that DiCaprio decried as evidence of   climate change have been occurring regularly for thousands of years in southern Alberta. These seasonal hot winds are known locally as Chinook winds. From the Calgary Sun: It would be hilarious, if the star of The Revenant wasn’t also the head of a   environmental lobby group, the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, and a producer of documentaries on climate change. If DiCaprio really got his chinook misinformation from a local, the actor should be furious. He’s been duped into looking like a   pure and simple. By declaring climate change a greater threat to mankind than the deadliest terror organization in the world, the actor is parroting the same message that Obama, Kerry, and Biden have been saying for years.

[According to a poll conducted by Chapman University, 42 per cent of Americans are afraid of clowns, whereas only 32 per cent are afraid of climate change.  They’re also more scared of terrorist attacks (41 per cent) gun rights infringement (38 per cent) family members dying (38 per cent) economic collapse (37 per cent) Obamacare (36 per cent) and biological warfare (35 per cent).

But are they scarier than real threats, like climate change, economic hardship, or the death of loved ones? According to Americans, yes. Yes, they are. I’d disagree. The results of the poll suggests that Americans have a generally sensible perspective on what constitutes a genuine threat to their wellbeing  —   top of the list, even higher than a terrorist attack, is corrupt government (61 per cent). Also, it accords well with a far more important global survey  —   so important it deserves a separate article which you can read here  —   showing just how low a priority climate change is for most people in the world. Essentially climate change has become a luxury problem which only liberals in rich countries can afford to worry about. For everyone else, there are many, many more pressing concerns  …",

    "text": "(CNN) President Barack Obama spoke in front of one of Yosemite National Park’s picturesque waterfalls on a   Saturday touting the importance of America’s parks, but cautioning the threat of climate change is real and affecting the planet now. The President and first family are visiting Yosemite to mark the 100th anniversary of the National Park system. The Obama’s visited Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico on Friday. In a speech with a small group of onlookers in front of the falls, Obama said he wants every child to be able to experience the beauty and majesty of the parks. He talked about his first visit to a big national park when he traveled from his native Hawaii to Yellowstone National Park. ”I remember being an    kid, the first time I saw a moose in lake. The first time we drove over a hill and suddenly there was a field full of deer. The first time I saw a bear and her cub. That changes you. You’re not the same after that. And I want to make sure every kid feels that,” Obama said.  Obama remarked not just on the beauty of the parks but also the threats they’re under from climate change. He said officials at Yosemite told him climate change has already forced some bird habitats to move further north and   wetlands have begun to dry up. Across the country, Obama said rising seas threaten everywhere from the Everglades to New York’s iconic State of Liberty. ”That’s not the America I want to pass on to the next generation. That’s not the legacy I think any of us want to leave behind. The idea that these places that sear themselves into your memory could be marred or lost to history, that’s to be taken seriously. We can’t treat these things as something that we deal with later,” Obama said. ”On this issue, unlike a lot of issues, there’s such a thing as being too late.” To that end, the Obama Administration helped forge the way in helping pass the Paris Agreement, a treaty where countries from around the globe have agreed to reduce greenhouse gases over time. Obama has also protected over 260 million acres of land and water, more than any other president. But those protections don’t always come without controversy, as local residents and politicians frequently become leery of federal interference with their lands.  The President also touted the economic benefits of the national parks, saying over 305 million people visited the parks in 2015 and for every one dollar the tourists spent, a further six dollars was generated in the area’s economy, supporting millions of jobs. Despite economic and climate change talk, there was no denying Obama was enjoying his time with family on Father’s Day weekend in one of America’s most famous national parks, remarking several times about the beauty of where he was standing during the speech. ”The parks belong to all of us,” Obama said. ”This planet belongs to all of us. It’s the only one we’ve got.”",

    "text": "(CNN) Climate change    long the subject of a divisive political debate    is getting a boost of fresh attention heading into the 2016 presidential campaign thanks to an unlikely public figure: the Pope.  The Vatican is set to release Pope Francis’ highly anticipated encyclical    an official document delivering teachings from the Pope    on the environment and climate change this week. Marking the second such document from the Pope since he assumed the papacy in March 2013, the encyclical is expected to cast the battle against global warming as a moral obligation.  With his famously warm and humble gestures and a vision for a more inclusive Catholic Church, Pope Francis has publicly addressed other sensitive political topics like   marriage, abortion and economic inequality. Environmental advocates are eager to see the head of the Catholic Church lend his enormous stature and influence to their cause. Democrats are largely united on climate change: They agree that global warming is caused by human activity, and that the government must take urgent action to head off deep,   consequences. RELATED: EPA moves toward regulating airplane emissions, But the issue is trickier for Republicans. The conservative base is fiercely resistant to government regulation, and the party receives enormous financial support from   companies. Many Republican elected officials have expressed skepticism about climate science some have said outright they believe global warming is a hoax. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party’s presumed frontrunner, slammed the GOP candidates for their positions on climate change during her first campaign rally on Saturday. ”Ask many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and they’ll say: ’I’m not a scientist,’” Clinton said. ”Well, then, why don’t they start listening to those who are?” Voters typically don’t point to climate change as their most pressing concern. But over the last few election cycles, climate change    similar to the issue of   marriage    has emerged at the center of a significant generational divide.  While issues like the economy and national security easily trump the environment in national polls, for some swing voters such as Hispanics and independents, climate change is a key indicator of whether a candidate is in the political mainstream.  The stakes are high for both sides: Environmentalists say the outcome of the next White House campaign will determine whether President Barack Obama’s environmental policies can be preserved. Critics of environmental regulations, some of whom deny that global warming is a provable phenomenon, argue the administration’s green agenda threatens to stymie economic growth. ”The 2016 presidential election will determine whether we continue on the path of reducing carbon pollution, working with other countries to get them to reduce their pollution, investing in clean energy    or undoing all of those things,” said Daniel Weiss of the League of Conservation Voters, a liberal group that mainly supports Democratic candidates.  So far, the 2016 presidential candidates fall into a few broad groups when it comes to climate: ”What global warming?” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, one of many candidates vying for the Republican nomination for president in 2016, represents a faction of the GOP that’s skeptical that global warming is a real phenomenon.  ”The satellite data demonstrate that there has been no significant warming whatsoever for 17 years,” Cruz said earlier this year, making the case that the ”global warming alarmists” don’t base their claims on facts.  Within the GOP base, this is not an uncommon view.  The Pew Research Center, which has surveyed public views on climate change for years, found in August that 43% of Republican and   U. S. adults believe there is ”no solid evidence” that the Earth is getting warmer. The majority of people across the political spectrum, however  —   around seven in 10 adults  —   say they believe there’s solid evidence of global warming.  ”Republicans as a group are less convinced that the Earth is warming and where they see warming, they’re more likely to think it’s based on natural patterns relative to their Democratic counterparts,” said Cary Funk, associate director for research at Pew.  Other candidates, like Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, have also expressed serious skepticism about the theory of global warming. ”Someone is an ignoramus who would say, ’Oh, we’ve had three hurricanes this year, this proves that somehow the climate is warming,’” Paul said last year.  Santorum, who landed in hot water for criticizing the Pope for weighing in on climate change, said this month that he’s disturbed by scientists who say the debate is ”settled.” ”All the predictions that were made 15 years ago, none of them have come true,” Santorum said on Fox News. ”So all of this certainty    this is what bothers me about this debate.”  ”Yes, the Earth is getting warmer    but we don’t know if it’s all  ” The majority of 2016 GOP presidential aspirants fall somewhere in the murky middle when it comes to climate change.  They acknowledge that climate change is a real and likely problematic development. But they’re also hesitant to put the blame squarely on the shoulders of humans and their   activities like  . ”I don’t think the science is clear of what percentage is   and what percentage is natural. It’s convoluted,” former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is expected to launch his White House bid on Monday, said last month in New Hampshire.  Fellow Floridian and declared presidential candidate Marco Rubio has followed a similar tack: ”Humans are not responsible for climate change in the way some of these people out there are trying to make us believe,” the senator recently said on CBS.  New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has also said global warming is ”real” and that he believes human activity is a contributor to the phenomenon, though to what degree is up for debate.  It’s a tricky balancing act for GOP candidates, who have to contend with the reality that swing voters like independents, millennials and Hispanics tend to be more concerned about the threat of climate change.  According to Pew’s August survey, 44% of independents see global climate change as a major threat to the country (compared to 25% of Republicans) 70% of Hispanics believe the Earth is getting warmer because of human activity (compared to 56% of   and 44% of whites) and adults 18  to 29 years old are most likely to say global warming is  .  ”The GOP needs an environmental policy” Former New York Gov. George Pataki, a longshot candidate for the GOP nomination for president and an environmentalist, is the favorite within the GOP field among environmental advocates.  Meanwhile, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, seeking the presidential nomination for the first time this cycle, is also trying to push his party on climate change. His message: Climate change is real, it is a   problem and the GOP needs a comprehensive plan to tackle it.  Graham said in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash this month that the GOP must both be the party of an energy policy  —   pursuing resources like oil, coal and natural gas  —   as well as environmental solutions.  ”What is the environmental policy of the Republican Party? When I ask that question, I get a blank stare,” Graham said. ”If I’m president of the United States, we’re going to address climate change and CO2 emissions in a   way.” Mike McKenna, a Republican strategist and energy lobbyist, said positions on climate change serve as a ”signal” to voters.  ”When Lindsey Graham said . .. that climate change is real and when I’m president we’re going to do something about it, that goes after the moderate votes in the Republican primary,” McKenna said. ”He wants to be the moderate standard bearer.” The Democrats, Environmentalists hope that if Democrats keep the White House next year, the next president will preserve and further promote Obama’s work to reduce carbon pollution and address global climate change.  Clinton has not yet delved deeply into policy proposals, but her campaign has billed climate change a priority for the former secretary of state.  Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, all seeking the party’s nomination for president, addressed climate change in their respective campaign launch speeches.  ”The announced Democratic candidates    Chafee, O’Malley, Clinton and Sanders  —   all have exhibited very strong climate leadership in their various positions,” said Weiss of the League of Conservation Voters.",

    "text": "(CNN) As a former teacher, Pope Francis knows how to deliver a stern lecture. On Thursday, he gave one for the ages.  While slamming a slew of modern trends    the heedless worship of technology, our addiction to fossil fuels and compulsive consumerism    the Pope said humanity’s ”reckless” behavior has pushed the planet to a perilous ”breaking point.”   ”Doomsday predictions,” the Pope warned, ”can no longer be met with irony or disdain.”  Citing the scientific consensus that global warming is disturbingly real, Francis left little doubt about who to blame.  Big businesses, energy companies,   politicians, scurrilous scientists, laissez faire economists, indifferent individuals, callous Christians and myopic media professionals. Scarcely any area of society escaped his  withering criticism.   ”The Earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth,” Francis said. ”In many parts of the planet, the elderly lament that once beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish.” Francis’ bracing manifesto came Thursday in the form of an encyclical, a letter traditionally addressed from St. Peter’s Square to the more than 1 billion Catholics across the globe. Derived from the Greek word for ”circle,” an encyclical is among the church’s most authoritative teaching documents.  Special coverage: How 2 degrees are key to climate change, But Francis has set his sights far beyond the circle of his church. With an eye toward several key climate change summits scheduled for later this year, the Pope said his letter is addressed to ”every person living on this planet.”  ”I would like to enter a dialogue with all people about our common home,” Francis said.  Critique of modern life, The humble invitation belies the damning analysis of modern life contained in the   encyclical, entitled ”Laudato Si.” The archaic Italian phrase, which means ”Praised Be To You,” appears in the ”Canticle of the Sun,” a song penned by St. Francis, the patron saint of ecology.   Read the full encyclical (PDF) Subtitled, ”On Care for Our Common Home,” the encyclical was published Thursday in at least five languages during a news conference at the Vatican. The document was more than a year in the making, church officials say, and draws on the work of dozens of scientists, theologians, scholars from various fields and previous popes.  ”We have a situation here,” said Janos Pasztor, the U. N.’s assistant   for climate change, ”in which science and religion are totally aligned.” Pasztor was part of a team that convened with church officials at the Vatican this April. The Pope’s highly anticipated encyclical recycles some of the   themes of his papacy: an abiding concern for the poor, a scorching critique of the idolatry of money and a facility for using evocative language to describe complex conundrums.  As the first Pope from the developing world, Francis brings a moral vision shaped not in the seminaries of Europe but in the slums of Buenos Aires, Argentina.  With language ranging from the majestic (lyrical poetry in praise of nature) to the mundane (take the bus!) the Pope put his signature stamp on a controversial topic and his moral clout on the line.  ”Laudato si” is long on laments and short on specific solutions, though the Pope repeatedly urges deep thinking and dialogue to address the complex symptoms now plaguing the planet. In broad strokes, Francis calls for a drastic change in ”lifestyle, production and consumption” from unsustainable habits to more mindful means of caring for ”our common home.” ”What kind of world do we want to leave to those who come after us, to children who are now growing up?” Francis asks. ”The question not only concerns the environment in isolation the issue cannot be approached piecemeal.”    And while the Pope calls for practical steps like recycling and improving public transportation, he said structural injustices require more political will and sacrifices than most societies seem willing to bear.   Nothing short of a ”bold cultural revolution” could save humanity from spiraling into   the Pope warned. Though it ends with a prayer, many parts of Francis’ encyclical seem profoundly pessimistic, particularly from a spiritual leader known for his hopeful messages of mercy and openness. People no longer seem to believe that happy days lie ahead, the Pope lamented, Our care for the environment is intimately connected to our care for each other, he argues, and we are failing miserably at both.  ”We are not faced with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social,” Francis writes, ”but rather one complex crisis which is both social and environmental.” The rich and powerful shut themselves up within   enclaves, Francis argues, compulsively consuming the latest goods to feed the emptiness within their hearts, while ignoring the plight of the poor.  The Pope’s 10 commandments on climate change, The poor, meanwhile, find themselves on the run from natural disasters and degraded habitats, shunted to the bottom of the world’s pile of problems with decreasing access to its natural resources.  Francis saves his most challenging questions for modern consumers, arguing that humanity has become enamored of another apple    and this time no Eve or serpent are around to take the fall. The temptation may have shifted from a forbidden fruit to cutting edge technology, but the sin remains the same: hubris.  ”We are not God,” the Pope warns, ”The Earth was here before us and has been given to us.”  Powerful quotes from the Pope’s encyclical, ’Bottom of the pile’ Though Popes since Paul VI in 1971 have addressed environmental degradation, ”Laudato Si” is the first encyclical to focus primarily on creation care, the Christian idea that God gave humans the earth to cultivate, not conquer.  Even months before its publication, the encyclical drew criticism from conservatives and climate change skeptics, who urged the Pope not to put his moral weight behind the controversial issue of global warming.  Many Catholics and environmentalists, meanwhile, eagerly awaited the encyclical. The   Catholic Climate Covenant, for example, plans to send homily hints to the 17, 000 Catholic parishes in the United States for priests to use during sermons this summer. The group is also planning media events with bishops in Iowa, California, New Mexico and elsewhere.  In the weeks before the encyclical’s release, Protestant pastors and at least 300 rabbis in the United States also said they were willing and eager to embrace Pope’s call for environmental justice. A Brazilian group made even made a    trailer ahead of Francis’ encyclical, portraying the pontiff of a spiritual superhero gearing for battle against the forces of evil    energy executives.  In another sign of the anticipation awaiting the encyclical, the news that an Italian magazine had published a leaked draft of the document online on Monday made the front pages of several American newspapers.  From the first days of his papacy, Francis has preached about the importance of the environment, not only as a scientific concern but also a moral one. In his first homily as pontiff, Francis called six times during the short sermon for humans to protect creation. The encyclical published on Thursday goes well beyond any sermons, delving into fields familiar to any Catholic, such as Scripture and theology, but also wandering into sociology, politics, urban planning, economics, globalization, biology and other areas of scientific research.  Broken into six chapters, ”Laudato Si” begins by cataloguing a host of ills wracking the planet: dirty air, polluted water, industrial fumes, toxic waste, rising sea levels and extreme weather.  The problem is ”aggravated,” the Pope said, ”by a model of development based on the intensive use of fossil fuels.”   If present trends continue, Francis argued, the changing climate will have grave implications for poor communities who lack the resources to adapt or protect themselves from natural disasters.  Many will be forced to leave their homes, while the economically and politically powerful ”mask” the problems or respond with indifference, the Pope said.  The poor may get a passing mention at global economic conferences, Francis says, but their problems seem to be merely added to agendas as an afterthought.  ”Indeed, when all is said and done,” the Pope said of the poor, ”they frequently remain on the bottom of the pile.”  Opinion: Listen to the Pope about climate, Technology takes over  Conservatives like Rush Limbaugh called Francis a Marxist after he released another statement, called an apostolic exhortation, in 2013. In the statement, the Pope called   economics ”crude” and ”naive.”  Limbaugh renewed the criticism on Wednesday, accusing Francis of adopting ”communist way of doing things: Controlling mankind through . .. governments backed by police or military power.” Apparently undeterred, the Pope doubles down on his critique of modern capitalism    especially aspects of the free market    in ”Laudato Si.”  ”We need to reject a magical conception of the market, which would suggest that the problems can be solved simply by an increase in the profits of companies or individuals,” he said.      What’s more, the Pope called the idea that the ”invisible forces of the market” can adequately regulate the economy the ”same kind of thinking” that leads to the ”exploitation of children and abandonment of the elderly who no longer serve our interests.”  In one particularly searing section, Francis compared laissez faire economists to mobsters, drug lords, illegal organ harvesters and human traffickers. All are part of a ”throwaway culture,” the Pope argues, that treats human beings as just another commodity to exploit.   The Pope’s attack on the ”myth of progress” is more surprising. But he connected his critique to a ”worshipping of earthly powers,” where humans have usurped the role of God, imposing our own laws and interests on reality with little thought to the   consequences.  Opinion: Message from Pope: Hey you, stop ignoring climate change, In particular, he argued that our ”cult of human power” and blind adoption of technology has been a Faustian bargain, offering a wealth of benefits, but at the risk of losing our souls. ”Life gradually becomes a surrender to situations conditioned by technology,” he said, ”itself viewed as the principle key to the meaning of existence.”   ”It has become countercultural,” Francis continued, ”to choose a lifestyle whose goals are even partly independent of technology.”  The omnipresent digital media feeds our ”information overload” and ”mental pollution,” the Pope said. Those, in turn, lead to an excessive   that tends to ”shield us from direct contact with the pain, the fears and the joys of others and the complexity of their personal experience.”   ”Nobody is suggesting a return to the Stone Age,” he continued, ”but we do need to slow down and look at reality in a different way.”  Despite his bleak view of our present situation, the Pope offered glimmers of hope near the end of his ”joyful and troubling” reflection.   ”Yet all is not lost,” Francis said. ”Human beings, while capable of the worst, are also capable of rising above themselves, choosing again what is good, and making a new start, despite their mental and social conditioning.”  Is the Pope right on technology? Getting business ’on board’ Opposition to the Pope’s encyclical began several months before it was released.  In April, the Heartland Institute, a conservative group skeptical of climate change, mounted a campaign to convince Pope Francis that global warming ”is not a crisis.” ”The Pope is putting his moral authority behind the radical environmental agenda of the United Nations    and he’s doing it after being told only part of the climate story,” Jim Lakely, a Heartland spokesman, said in an email interview on Tuesday.  Lakely said Heartland will contact ”hundreds of thousands of Catholics” in the United States through mail and email countering the Pope’s message and ”giving them the truth about climate change.” That may be a difficult task.  More Americans trust Francis almost any other world or U. S. leader as a source of information on global warming, according to a  survey conducted by Yale University and George Mason University. Still, the same poll showed that less than 10% of Americans view climate change as a moral issue.  5 key questions about the Pope and climate change, According to a Pew Research Center study released on Tuesday,  American Catholics are divided along partisan lines over climate change. More than 7 in 10 believe the planet is getting warmer, and nearly half attribute global warming to human causes. A similar number (48%) view it as a very serious problem, according to Pew.  But while more than 80% of Catholic Democrats say there is solid evidence that the Earth is warming, just half of Catholic Republicans agree. And less than a quarter of Catholic Republicans believe that global warming is a   or poses a very serious problem. Christiana Peppard, a professor of ethics at Fordham University, said she is not surprised that more Catholics are unconvinced that climate change presents a moral imperative.  ”There’s an idea that science exists in a realm separate from the way we live our lives,” said Peppard, author of the book ”Just Water: Theology, Ethics, and the Global Water Crisis.”  But the Catholic Church has long taught that scientific facts, while reliable, don’t answer deeper questions about human meaning and morality. ”For that, ethical reasoning and contemplation are important,” Peppard said.   On the 2016 campaign trail, though, the Pope’s   seemed to be a tough sell.  Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who is Catholic, said the Pope should ”leave science to the scientists.”  At a town hall in New Hampshire this week, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Catholic convert, said, ”I don’t get economic policies from my bishops or my cardinals or my Pope. I think religion ought to be about making us better as people and less about things that end up getting into the political realm.” Pope hands GOP climate change dilemma, Other Catholics, though, were eagerly awaiting the Pope’s encyclical.  In addition to Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, the Vatican panel presenting ”Laudato Si” included Metropolitan John of Pergamon, an Eastern Orthodox priest John Schellenuber, founding Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research Carolyn Wo, the   director of Catholic Relief Services and Valeria Martano, an Italian historian and member of the   lay Catholic Community of Sant’Egidio.  Woo said her assignment is to connect the encyclical’s concerns to the business world. Over the past 20 years, said Woo, former dean of the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business, some corporations have adopted more ethical approaches, and she expects a wave of letters from business leaders this week praising the Pope’s initiative.  ”The bottom line is that we need business, not just some, but all, to do more,” Woo said. ”They are the ones on the front lines. We need them on board.” The Pope will also need world leaders to buy into his moral message, which will be key before a U. N.  climate summit in December, said Pasztor of the U. N.  At the meeting, nations are expected to submit their plans for reducing greenhouse gases, and the Pope will likely repeat the encyclical’s entreaties when he speaks at the U. N. General Assembly this September. ”Having such an important person as the Pope talking about this issue will reach a lot of people,” Pazstor said, ”and at a crucial time.”   How a scientist in a parking lot may have influenced the Pope",

    "text": "In his message for the “World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation” Thursday, Pope Francis said that   global warming, as well as a loss of biodiversity are “sins” against God, which must be atoned for by planting trees, avoiding the use of plastic and paper and “separating refuse. ”[“Global warming continues, due in part to human activity,” Francis said, adding that “2015 was the warmest year on record, and 2016 will likely be warmer still. ”  “This is leading to ever more severe droughts, floods, fires and extreme weather events. Climate change is also contributing to the   refugee crisis. The world’s poor, though least responsible for climate change, are most vulnerable and already suffering its impact,” he wrote. Repeatedly citing the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who has “courageously and prophetically continued to point out our sins against creation,” Francis made his own a new list of such environmental sins, which include pollution, global warming and deforestation. For human beings to “destroy the biological diversity of God’s creation,” to “degrade the integrity of the earth by causing changes in its climate,” to “contaminate the earth’s waters, its land, its air, and its life —  these are sins,” he wrote. Summing up, the Pope stated that “to commit a crime against the natural world is a sin against ourselves and a sin against God. ” Lamenting “the devastation of the environment,” Francis said that “God gave us a bountiful garden, but we have turned it into a polluted wasteland of debris, desolation and filth. ” Specifically regarding a loss of biodiversity, the Pope suggested that now there are fewer species to give glory to God. “We must not be indifferent or resigned to the loss of biodiversity and the destruction of ecosystems, often caused by our irresponsible and selfish behavior,” Francis said. “Because of us, thousands of species will no longer give glory to God by their very existence, nor convey their message to us. We have no such right. ” The Pope said that the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation was instituted in order to give believers an opportunity to “reaffirm their personal vocation to be stewards of creation. ” It also furnishes an occasion to thank God for the gift of creation, to implore his help for its protection and to beg “his pardon for the sins committed against the world in which we live. ” During this Jubilee Year, “let us learn to implore God’s mercy for those sins against creation that we have not hitherto acknowledged and confessed,” Francis said, while proposing that Christians need to undergo an “ecological conversion. ” Now is the time to “acknowledge our sins against creation,” the Pope said. “Inasmuch as we all generate small ecological damage,” we are called to acknowledge “our contribution, smaller or greater, to the disfigurement and destruction of creation. ” “Let us repent of the harm we are doing to our common home,” he added. If our ecological conversion is real, Francis said, it will lead to concrete ways of thinking and acting that are more respectful of creation. Among these are “avoiding the use of plastic and paper, reducing water consumption, separating refuse, cooking only what can reasonably be consumed, showing care for other living beings, using public transport or   planting trees, turning off unnecessary lights, or any number of other practices. ” In his message, the Pope also applauded “a growing global political consensus” regarding the environment, praising the adoption of “Sustainable Development Goals” as well as last December’s Paris Agreement on climate change, “which set the demanding yet fundamental goal of halting the rise of the global temperature. ” Apparently the pontiff’s prayers have already been heard, since scientists are now forecasting that 2017 will be a cooler year than 2016.

    "text": "(CNN) The Alaskan  village of Shishmaref voted this week to surrender to global warming and move its ancestral home. The Tuesday vote was close.   people voted to move Shishmaref to the Alaska mainland while 78 voted to stay and fight the rising tide, said Donna Barr, secretary of the Shishmaref Council. Nearly all the 169 registered voters showed up to the village meeting to vote, she said. The vote was important, perhaps more in symbolism than substance, because while the move isn’t  imminent, when it happens, both the financial and emotional cost will be great. Their people have been there a long time. And leaving means giving up a way of life. ”Our community on this island has seen artifacts about 500 years old,” Barr said. Now they have to decide how to pay for the escape. It is a buck they plan to pass. ”About 15 years ago, they estimated the cost at $180 million, but I would figure it’s much higher now,” Barr said. ”We don’t see the move happening in our lifetime because of the funding.” In the end, all that might leave is the people. The isolated village    accessible by airplane, boat and snowmobile when the ice is thick enough    sits on Sarichef Island in the Chukchi Sea. It’s just north of the Bering Strait, 123 miles north of Nome, which is pretty close to the Arctic Circle, The village works a bit like a mine’s canary regarding global warming. Villagers can see it getting sicker as the planet heats up. CNN has made trips there to document the changing weather conditions. ”The land is going away,” Shelton Kokeok, then 65, told CNN in 2009. ”I think it’s going to vanish one of these days.” For decades, its approximately 650 villagers, largely members of the Inupiat tribe of the Inuit, have been watching warming temperatures melt the sea ice and the permafrost, resulting in more coastal erosion as the sea waters eat up the barrier island. Houses have tumbled into the water and others have had to be moved to stable land. There are at least 31 Alaskan villages facing similar threats, according to a study by the U. S. Government Accountability Office. And while a dozen of them are considering relocating, the report says that many or most may not be eligible for federal funding. The villagers have struggled with the warming temperatures for years. Esau Sinnok, a Shishmaref native and Arctic youth ambassador in a program started by the Interior and State departments, wrote an essay in which he lamented that the tiny island had lost nearly 3, 000 feet of land to coastal erosion since 1980. The poor village of mostly manufactured houses has been struggling with the idea of moving itself to the mainland at least since 2000, he said. But the financial cost and the emotional toll of leaving has always been too great for many of the residents. ”The problem we’ve been facing for the last 40 years is there is no money from the federal or state government,” Barr said. But the global warming might mean they will have no choice. It also has been eroding their way of life in other ways. While a few decades ago, ice was fully formed by October, now it takes to December, and ice isn’t thick enough to cross it safely, Sinnok said. Sarichef Island, about a   wide in the center, sits between the Chukchi Sea and the wide estuary of the Serpentine River. That has been prime real estate for hunting and fishing, the main forms of survival and employment in Shishmaref. In the winter, Shishmaref residents hack tiny cylinders of ice out of the estuary to fish for tomcod and smelt. In the summer, they harvest cloudberries and blueberries caribou herds roam across the vast expanse of inland tundra. ”The lack of ice has affected our hunting, fishing and other traditions,” Sinnok wrote in his essay last December. ”Every year it gets harder and harder to collect enough meat for the winter. Tomcod and whitefish are a large part of our winter diet, but since the ice forms later in the year, it’s more difficult for us to gather enough food.”",

    "text": "(CNN) New climate change records have come along to remind us that Earth’s thermostat is steadily pushing upward.  More exactly, there are two global high temperature records and a smattering of climate change low points. March 2015 was the warmest March since   began in 1880, says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And the first quarter of 2015 was the warmest first quarter on record in those same 136 years. That gives 2015 a stab at trumping the hottest year on record    which was  2014.   The uninterrupted continuation of the warming trend is no surprise.  The 10 warmest years on record have occurred in the past 17 years.  And though the rise in the last 10 years has been gentle by comparison, since 1910, the clear trend has been up, according to NASA’s Global   Temperature Index.  In the latter two thirds of that time, warming and the effects on climate have been epochal, says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ”Since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia.” That new March record, March 2015 edged past the last record high March, which was in 2010, rising by 0. 09 degrees Fahrenheit (0. 05 C).  Average global land and water temperatures for the first quarter of this year beat the last record first quarter, 2002, by the same margin. Yet another broken record this March was more obvious to the eye. The expanse of Arctic sea ice shrunk to an absolute low for any March on record.  ”The average Arctic sea ice extent for March was 430, 000 square miles (7. 2 percent) below the    average. This was the smallest March extent since records began in 1979,” NOAA said.  Small gains, large net loss, On the other end of the globe    in the Antarctic    sea ice has been on the gain, and this year, it hit a record March high.  But globally, the overall result is a big net loss. ”The upward trend in the Antarctic . .. is only about a third of the magnitude of the rapid loss of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean,” according to NASA.  Natural ice continues disappearing elsewhere.  Californians in particular have noticed the lack of snow on their mountain peaks, a major source of their dwindling water supply. The warming trend has reduced snow coverage throughout the Northern hemisphere, especially reducing the amount of coverage in spring.  This March, Northern Hemisphere snow coverage was the seventh lowest on record, NOAA said. NASA: Much more to come, But all this is nothing compared to what lies ahead, NASA says. What it expects for the    future is unprecedented in contemporary weather records, unprecedented in at least the past 1, 000 years.   If carbon emissions continue on course, further temperature rises should bring   megadroughts to the western half of the United States in this century.  Wait. That would be yet another record.  This March saw the highest level of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere since record keeping began. Not the highest level for any March but the highest level ever at 400 parts per million, NOAA says. Considering the rising carbon dioxide trend, NASA has run 17 climate models on supercomputers with data spanning the past 1, 000 years. The agency concludes from the calculations that there is an 80% chance of megadroughts lasting 20 to 40 years. The current severe drought that has decimated California’s water supply has lasted about three years. The drought that turned much of the U. S. West into the Dust Bowl in the 1930s lasted 10 years.",

Please follow the steps below, NEWS BRIEF Days of downpour have flooded rivers in Louisiana and pushed them to overflow at   levels, leading to the evacuation of 20, 000 people. Governor John Bel Edwards called it a “historic, unprecedented flooding event. ” The federal government declared it a major disaster for four parishes around Baton Rouge. Others may soon be added. More than 10, 000 people are staying in shelters, and cellular networks in some areas are down, which have compounded what has already been a frantic rescue effort. At least five people have died as a result of the floods, and officials say they expect that number to rise as rescue efforts continue. The historic flooding was largely the cause of rain, which saturated the ground and flooded some rivers to levels six feet above their record heights. The waters have flooded areas of cities that have never before been flooded, and in some areas people were trapped atop their homes, and inside their cars, as the roadways turned into rivers. Meanwhile, rescue workers and citizens who own boats drove around looking for people to help, like in this dramatic video where a man pulls a woman and her dog from a sinking car: The rain began falling on Friday, dropping about 10 inches in some parts of the state. It continued on Saturday, with some areas receiving nearly 17 inches in one day. The rain let up on Sunday, and rescue workers in helicopters rescued people stranded on the roofs of their submerged homes. By Monday morning, the storm had passed over the region, headed for parts of East Texas.",

    "text": "Barack Obama has said the Paris climate deal could prove a “turning point” in the effort to avoid dangerous global warming, after a flurry of commitments by nations pushed the agreement into force. The climate accord is set to be activated on 4 November after the European Union, Canada, Nepal and India all formally ratified the deal. The latest ratifications mean that 73 nations accounting for nearly 57% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions are fully committed to the process, meaning the two key thresholds to the agreement have now been met. Obama said: “Today is a historic day in the fight to protect our planet for future generations. This gives us the best possible shot to save the one planet we got. With optimism and faith and hope, we are proving it is possible. ” The US president said the Paris agreement will prove a “turning point” in the fight against climate change, should nations fully commit to cutting emissions. The US and China, the world’s two largest emitters, both ratified the agreement in September.  Obama said the deal, which commits countries to ensuring that the average global temperature doesn’t rise 2C above   levels, will “open the floodgates for   innovation at a scale we haven’t seen before”. But he warned that emissions will need to be scaled back even further, along with mooted cutbacks in aviation and HFC pollution, if runaway climate change is to be avoided. “No nation, not even one as powerful as ours, can solve this on its own  —   we have to do this together,” he said. “Even if we meet every target, we will only get to part of where we need to go. But this will help delay or avoid the worst consequences of climate change. It’ll help set bolder targets. ” The Paris agreement, struck last year, calls for all 195 signatories to come up with their own voluntary plans to reduce emissions. While the landmark deal is the first commitment by all countries to reduce emissions, the individual pledges are unlikely to be sufficient to stay within the 2C limit, which could be breached as early as 2050, according to recent research. Separate studies have shown the world is on course for a temperature rise of around 3. 5C by the end of the century, based on the emissions cuts promised in Paris. This would cause a range of disastrous environmental consequences, including heatwaves, sea level rise, species extinctions and spread of disease. There are doubts that the US is on track even to meet its initial promise to cut emissions by 26% to 28% by 2025 by 2005 levels. In a further complication, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has promised to withdraw the US from the deal should he win power. However, the ratification locks countries into the deal for four years, so an immediate US exit wouldn’t be possible.  But green groups have celebrated the activation of the Paris deal, pointing to the lightening pace of ratification after decades of international wrangling over climate change. United Nations agreements often take years to come into force, with the Paris deal taking less than a year to pass its ratification thresholds.  “The unprecedented speed of the entry into force of the Paris agreement demonstrates that Paris was not a   deal, but rather a   commitment to climate action,” said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International.  Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, added: “After years of tireless dedication and work toward an international climate deal, the Paris agreement has finally jumped off the page and into reality.   “Now that the agreement is a reality, we must finally align our global energy and economic policies to meet these goals and end subsidies for outdated fossil fuels, transition to 100 percent clean energy, and stop harmful trade agreements like the   Partnership that run counter to the goals of the Paris Agreement. ”  Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and a key architect of the Paris deal, said the deal should be met with “unbridled optimism. ”  “We now we have our starting signal  —   this is the “go” toward a low carbon future,” she said. “That future is going to be exciting: ending the dominance of fossil fuels will deliver an abundance of innovation and opportunity for all of us.   “We can deliver cleaner air, healthier cities and a new kind of ‘industrial’ revolution underpinned by technologies that enable us to live a prosperous life within the boundaries our planet can sustain. To achieve that, we must now increase our ambition to ensure the legacy of this moment is sealed as a positive pivot point in history. ”",

    "text": "In Siberia, melting permafrost released anthrax that had been frozen in a reindeer carcass for decades, starting a deadly outbreak. In Baghdad, soaring temperatures forced the government to shut down for days at a time. In Kuwait, thermometers hit a record 54C (129F). July was the hottest month the world has endured since records began in 1880, scientists have said, and brought a painful taste of the troubles people around the world may have to grapple with as global warming intensifies. Results compiled by Nasa showed the month was 0. 84C hotter than the   average for July, and 0. 11C hotter than the previous record set in July 2015. The temperature increase last month was not all due to climate change. Part of the increase came from the tail end of the El Niño phenomenon, which spreads warm water across the Pacific, giving a boost to global temperatures. But scientists said the July record, which came after a string of new   temperatures, was particularly striking because it came as the impact of El Niño faded, and added weight to fears that 2016 will go down in history as the hottest year since records began. “Even if we have it augmented by El Niño, it’s quite concerning as a citizen to see that we are flirting with very high numbers, and a record is a record,” said   Thepaut, head of Europe’s Copernicus climate change service. He had not expected such a warm July, and said that although his organisation did not forecast temperatures, the high temperatures continued through the start of August and made a record for the year extremely likely. “What we can say over the last seven months is that every month has been a record we are on good track to have another record year,” he said. Beyond immediate trends,   weather patterns made clear the rise could not be dismissed as the impact of a severe El Niño, he said. “One fact beyond what we are seeing today, among the last warmest years, 15 years have been obtained in the 21st century and we have not been in El Niño for 10 years. So there is a general   trend,” Thepaut said. The challenge for climate scientists, and politicians seeking to drive climate policy, has often been linking changes in global averages to shifting weather patterns at home that may or may not appear to reflect the worldwide data.  “This is a global average, so it can be difficult for people everywhere to perceive it themselves,” said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the LSE’s Grantham research institute on climate change and the environment. As extremes become more common, however, that is also starting to change, even in places such as the UK where changes have so far been relatively more manageable.  “We can see that locally there is evidence of changes in many places  —   for instance, in the UK, our eight warmest years have all occurred since 2000, as have six of our seven wettest years, so the UK is becoming warmer and wetter. ” The provisional average temperature in the UK for July was 15. 3C, which is 0. 2C above the     average, according to the Met Office. However, it is well below the record set in 2006, the hottest UK month on record, when the average temperature was 17. 8C. The temperature increases in July were not spread evenly, with brutal heat across the Middle East potentially warning of troubles to come for a region that is particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures.  Climate scientists say individual areas of extreme weather cannot be directly linked to global warming even as overall temperatures rise, but they give an indication of the challenges to come in a hotter world. “If the global mean [average] increases a certain amount, the temperatures in this region in summer will increase even more,” said Jos Lelieveld, an atmospheric researcher at the Max Planck institute for chemistry, who earlier this year published a report on how climate change would affect the Middle East and North Africa. He warned then that large areas could become so hot that they would be virtually uninhabitable for human beings, and could trigger an exodus of hundreds of millions of refugees. The July temperatures just underlined the urgency of the crisis, he said. “This worries me a lot because we have a lot of problems there already there is a documented drought that has been going on for fifteen years,” he said. “This is already one of the driest regions in the world. ” Some experts think those problems have already contributed to the violence in the region, with some researchers claiming drought fuelled Syria’s civil war.  But perhaps because of the huge security and humanitarian crises crippling many countries there, most governments have spared little thought to dealing with a problem that seems less urgent, even if its fallout could be just as devastating. “Climate change and challenges associated with it or provoked by it didn’t yet reach the attention of heads of states,” said Adel Abdellatif, a senior regional advisor with the UN development programme focused on climate change in the region. “Attention is mainly paid to threats emanating from armed groups, and climate change threats are not seen within the framework of national security,” he said. Adding to the problem is the fact that those likely to be most vulnerable to the flooding, droughts and rising temperatures are those least able to push for change, both within countries and across the region. “Those affected by threats of climate change are the people living at the edge of vulnerability and in the frontline of the perfect storm,” said Abdellatif. When Kuwait recorded temperatures of 54C this summer, the highest ever recorded in the eastern hemisphere, its relatively wealthy citizens were mostly able to combat the raging heat by turning on the air conditioning. In neighbouring Iraq, where electricity supplies are sporadic, not everyone can afford coolers and millions of refugees were stranded under little more than tents in the desert, heat is much more dangerous. The July temperatures have given added urgency to calls for governments to deliver on commitments made in Paris last year to limit temperature rises to 1. 5C beyond   levels  —   a limit not far off the record set in July. “People should be in no doubt that global warming continues apace and that should focus governments on the task of delivering what was agreed in Paris last year,” said the LSE’s Ward.  Nasa’s records indicate July was about 1. 3C warmer than the   average, said David Karoly, a climate scientist from the University of Melbourne, who pointed out that Nasa’s baseline temperatures already included about 0. 5C of warming in global temperatures.  Karoly said about 0. 2C of that anomaly was likely to be owing to El Niño, leaving about 1. 1C mostly caused by   climate change.  Additional reporting by Michael Slezak",

    "text": "The new head of the Environmental Protection Agency said on Thursday he is not convinced that carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of climate change and said he wants Congress to weigh in on whether CO2 is a harmful pollutant that should be regulated. In an interview with CNBC, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said the Trump administration will make an announcement on fuel efficiency standards for cars ”very soon,” stressing that he and President Donald Trump believe current standards were rushed through. Pruitt, 48, is a climate change denier who sued the agency he now leads more than a dozen times as Oklahoma’s attorney general. He said he was not convinced that carbon dioxide pollution from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal is the main cause of climate change, a conclusion widely embraced by scientists. ”I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact,” he told CNBC.  ”So no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,” Pruitt said. ”But we don’t know that yet, we need to continue to debate, continue the review and analysis. ” Trump campaigned on a promise to roll back environmental regulations ushered in by former President Barack Obama, including those aimed at combating climate change. He framed his stand as aimed at boosting U. S. businesses, including the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries. ”We can be     and ” Pruitt said Wednesday afternoon in a Houston speech at CERAWeek, the world’s largest gathering of energy executives. Scientists immediately criticized Pruitt’s statement, saying it ignores a large body of evidence collected over decades that shows fossil fuel burning as the main factor in climate change. ”We can’t afford to reject this clear and compelling scientific evidence when we make public policy. Embracing ignorance is not an option,” Ben Santer, climate researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said in a statement.  The Supreme Court unleashed a fury of regulation and litigation when it ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases are an air pollutant that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Two years later, the EPA declared carbon dioxide and five other   gases to be pollutants. Pruitt said the Supreme Court’s decision should not have been viewed as permission for the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. ”Decisions were made at the executive branch level that didn’t respect the rule of law,” Pruitt said in his Houston speech.  REGULATING CO2 Pruitt has previously said the EPA should not regulate CO2 without a law passed by Congress authorizing it to do so. The   Congress could potentially issue a strong signal to the EPA that carbon dioxide should not be regulated by the agency, a move that would undermine many   rules aimed at curbing emissions. ”Administrator Pruitt is correct, the Congress has never explicitly given the EPA the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant and the committee has no plans to do so,” said Mike Danylak, spokesman for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the panel that oversees the EPA.  When asked at his confirmation hearing in January whether he would uphold the EPA endangerment finding, Pruitt said it was the ”law of the land” and he was obliged to uphold it for now. Pruitt declined to respond to a question from a reporter after his Houston speech on whether he would now seek to overturn the endangerment finding.  As Oklahoma’s attorney general, Pruitt and another dozen attorney generals unsuccessfully challenged the endangerment finding in a federal appeals court. ”The mask is off. After obscuring his true views during his Senate confirmation hearings, Scott Pruitt has outed himself as a pure climate denier,” said David Doniger, director of the climate program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The new EPA chief said he was committed to ensuring thorough processes for environmental rules and regulations to reduce ”regulatory uncertainty.” Pruitt added that he shared Trump’s view that the global climate accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015 was a ”bad deal.” Trump promised during his campaign for the White House to pull the United States out of the accord, but has since been mostly quiet on the issue.

    "text": "Southeastern Australia has suffered through a series of brutal heat waves over the past two months, with temperatures reaching a scorching 113 degrees Fahrenheit in some parts of the state of New South Wales. “It was nothing short of awful,” said Sarah   of the Climate Change Research Center at the University of New South Wales, in Sydney. “In Australia, we’re used to a little bit of heat. But this was at another level. ” So Dr.   who studies climate extremes, did what comes naturally: She looked to see whether there was a link between the heat and   climate change. Her analysis, conducted with a   group of researchers called World Weather Attribution, was made public on Thursday. Their conclusion was that climate change made maximum temperatures like those seen in January and February at least 10 times more likely than a century ago, before significant greenhouse gas emissions from human activity started warming the planet. Looked at another way, that means that the kind of soaring temperatures expected to occur in New South Wales once every 500 years on average now may occur once every 50 years. What is more, the researchers found that if climate change continued unabated, such maximum temperatures may occur on average every five years. For the overall   summer in New South Wales, the researchers say, climate change made the hot average temperatures  —   which set records for the state  —   at least 50 times more likely than in the past. The findings are the latest in what has become a growing field: studies that try to assess the influence of climate change on extreme weather as soon as possible. The idea is to offer scientific analyses of heat waves, floods and other events while people are still talking about them, and to counter the spread of misinformation, intentional or not, about the impact of global warming. Climate scientists have long said that climate change should bring an increase in extreme events like dry spells and heat waves. Because warmth causes more evaporation and warmer air holds more moisture, climate change should also lead to more intense and frequent storms. Studies have shown that these effects are occurring on a broad scale. But the natural variability of weather makes looking at individual events more difficult. World Weather Attribution, which is coordinated by Climate Central, a research organization in Princeton, N. J. is one of a number of groups doing rapid analysis. Among other events, they have looked at flooding in Germany and France last May high temperatures in the Arctic in November and December and an usually strong storm that hit northern Britain in 2015. Not all attribution studies have found a   link. In general, studies of heat waves tend to produce the clearest signal of the influence, or not, of global warming. Australian heat waves have been examined in the past, most recently in several studies that showed a clear link between climate change and a period of torrid weather in 2013. David Karoly, a scientist at the University of Melbourne, was involved in one of the studies, which took more than six months to produce. “That was considered very rapid at the time,” Dr. Karoly said. As a member of World Weather Attribution, Dr. Karoly helped with the study of the recent heat waves, which took about two weeks. A big difference between the two studies is in the use of computer climate models  —   both of the current atmosphere with its greenhouse gas emissions and of a hypothetical atmosphere as if those emissions had never occurred and climate change was not happening. For the older study, as for most attribution studies in the recent past, the models were run over and over again, which took months. The newer, rapid studies use models that have already been run, extracting data as needed.",

[In an editorial piece for The Huffington Post, Palermo addressed his concerns over climate change denial on the political right. Palermo argued that Trump shouldn’t be allowed to use internet technology like Twitter because of his attitudes towards climate change science.  “I’ve always believed that people who dismiss science in one area shouldn’t be able to benefit from science in others,” he wrote. “If Trump and his cohort believe the science of global warming is bogus then they shouldn’t be allowed to use the science of the Internet for their Twitter accounts, the science of global positioning for their drones, or the science of nuclear power for their weaponry. ” Palermo claimed that Trump wasn’t the only influential republican that he was concerned about with regards to attitudes towards climate change science. It’s not just the people around Trump who reject the science of climate change. The leadership of the Republican Party  —   from House Speaker Paul Ryan to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to the chairs of the key science and technology committees in Congress, to the Republicans’ favorite think tanks  —   all share the fossil fuel industry’s preference that the U. S. government does nothing to address the most serious planetary crisis humanity has ever faced. The Republicans’ cravenness on climate change is clear. After claiming for years that the science was “inconclusive” (or a “hoax”) they held the public position that they opposed any concerted action to reduce greenhouse gases because China and India would never go along. Then, in 2015, when China and India signed on to the Paris Climate accords, Mitch McConnell and the Republican leaders began telling foreign governments that the Republicans would fight against any international deal on climate change in any case. Palermo has a history of radical statements. Writing in the LA Progressive, Palermo claimed that the 2016 Presidential election “felt at times like the prolonged public lynching of the nation’s first black president. ”",

    "text": "A report examining the many ways climate change threatens coffee and coffee farmers has alarmed people who are now imagining what it would be like getting through the day without their caffeine fix. The report, released this month by the Climate Institute, a nonprofit organization in Australia, was commissioned by Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand, the regional hub of the global Fairtrade system. Though it contains little new research, it has made waves by collating an array of available literature indicating that climate change will have a stark effect on the world’s coffee supply. The report emphasizes the threat warming temperatures pose to farmland, citing a study from the March 2015 issue of the journal Climatic Change that found climate change “will reduce the global area suitable for coffee by about 50 percent across emission scenarios. ” In addition to the disappearing land on which to grow coffee, the report highlights the way warmer weather is exacerbating the threat of diseases like coffee rust and pests like the coffee berry borer, a type of beetle that a 2011 report said caused annual losses of hundreds of millions of dollars in coffee beans. “The extra warmth is enabling those sorts of lines of attack to be strengthened,” said John Connor, the chief executive of the Climate Institute. Coffee plants thrive in stable environments where a precise combination of temperature and precipitation allows beans to prosper while keeping their taste profile. The report shows that countries once offering the proper mix of climate factors in the “bean belt,” including Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Ethiopia and Vietnam, have become less hospitable because of shifts in weather patterns scientists say can be attributed to climate change. The report’s findings, though new to many people, are all too familiar to major coffee companies, which have been scrambling to battle climate change’s effect on their product for the past several years. “It’s a severe threat,” said Doug Welsh, the vice president of coffee at Peet’s Coffee and a member of the board of World Coffee Research, an international group founded by coffee companies intent on protecting their cash crop. “It’s anecdotal, but I don’t know any coffee farmers who don’t believe that their weather, and with it their disease and productivity issues, have changed dramatically over the last decade,” he said. A spokeswoman from Starbucks, Haley P. Drage, said that the company had been offering coffee growers support programs for years to help ensure the longevity of their farms. “This becomes even more important when farmers experience fluctuating weather conditions that are the result of a warmer climate,” she said. “We believe that with the proper vigilance, as well as a   approach, we can help farmers manage the variables that come with these new dynamics. ” But Mr. Welsh, touting the benefits of the World Coffee Research group, said, “There is no coffee company on the face of the earth that’s big enough to tackle the challenge of climate change on its own. ” The strategies the organization is developing acknowledge the severity of the threat from climate change, and many are adaptive rather than preventive  —   taking for granted that temperatures are bound to keep rising. For instance, one project aims to create a gene bank to preserve the genetic diversity in Arabica coffee. Another strategy is the creation of a variety catalog with information on various beans’ pest resistance, yield and ability to thrive at certain altitudes. A third is a “sensory lexicon” in which the organization evaluates the new coffee varieties being developed by coffee breeders to ensure their palatability. But even the organization’s website acknowledges that “there are major gaps in our knowledge of how to best help coffee producers adapt to climate change. ” Mr. Welsh said, “No one, of course, would want to see any coffee species go extinct, but we have to prepare for the distinct possibility that that could happen. ” Molly Harriss Olson, the chief executive of Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand, said she was particularly concerned about coffee producers and the impact warming temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns would have on them. “Coffee supports the livelihoods of 125 million people around the world, including some of the most marginalized and poor people in developing countries,” she said, citing a report from the International Coffee Organization. “If we don’t do something about it soon, the consequences for these people are going to be absolutely devastating. ”",

Figures have suggested that in July alone surface ice declined by 197 gigatonnes � equivalent to about 80 million Olympic swimming pools.Now experts have examined the level of melting in more detail, revealing what drove it. Crucially, the team note, the high pressure conditions lasted for 63 of the 92 summer days in 2019, compared with an average of just 28 days between 1981 and 2010. A similar situation was seen in 2012, a record bad year for melting of the ice sheet.",

Offsetting�s real power is to provide not a climate solution, but a social licence to continue with business as usual.

The group said they want people �to think about the whole picture and all the consequences that simplistic speeches calling � for a �drastic reduction of livestock� could have on Europe�s rural areas and on society in general.�The campaign group says the current debate around meat and livestock has been one-sided, and that livestock�s contribution to biodiversity, bioenergy and the rural economy has been overlooked. �An EU without livestock would not only lose locally produced food, but also essential habitats and biodiversity. It would also mean increased fires, lack of natural fertiliser and green energy, and a rural exodus,� it says.Europeans eat more than twice as much meat as experts recommend. A report last year called for a 40�50% reduction in the size of Europe�s meat and livestock sector to reduce its environmental footprint.Research published in Nature journal concluded that beef consumption in western countries needs to fall by 90% in order to avoid dangerous climate change.

This would mean household electric bills would go up by 43% cumulatively over the next decade on average � more in countries that still rely heavily on coal in electricity generation, less elsewhere. Gasoline would cost 14% more on average.�Calculations by the IMF�s economists show that a $75-a-ton carbon tax would also lead � once inflation has been taken into account � to an average 214% increase in the cost of coal and a 68% increase in natural gas.

They also introduce new fines for the use of such devices.When the laws were announced in August, the state government made claims � but has offered no evidence to support them � that activists were using devices �laced with booby traps� and �designed to harm�.The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and the police minister, Mark Ryan, on Wednesday cited two recent actions by Extinction Rebellion protesters they believed were dangerous and put people in harm�s way.The include a man who chained himself to a railway on Wednesday morning and a man who dangled for several hours from the Story Bridge over the Brisbane River on Tuesday. The man who hung suspended from the bridge reportedly said afterwards that it would be �dangerous for the police to come and rescue me�.",

As chairman I was taken a little bit aback,� he said.�There was some strong resistance on the call from Pacific Island leaders for more concrete works to reduce greenhouse gases, but to particularly cut down and stop new coalmines in Australia,� said Sopoaga.Throughout the forum Scott Morrison repeatedly spoke of the evident impact of climate change on Tuvalu, but said Australia was a good international partner on climate change and was on track to reduce its emissions in line with Paris targets.The ABC filmed the episode at the University of South Pacific in Fiji�s capital of Suva earlier on Monday, the first time Q&A has been filmed in the Pacific, and one of the few times the program has been filmed outside Australia.",

Components that underpin all four criteria have deteriorated, the report says.Under one criterion, covering how the ecosystem works, the report says: �Climate change is having a detrimental impact on some critical regulating processes such as sea temperature, reef building and recruitment (the addition of new young to the population) which means the ability of the system to �bounce back� is weakening.�Limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C is �widely cited as a critical threshold for the Reef,� the report says.Australia is taking �strong action� on climate change, the report maintains, saying a target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030 was a �significant contribution to global climate action�.",

Even half a degree higher will significantly increase the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for millions of people.The letter piles pressure on Timmermans, who is due to unveil the EU�s long-awaited climate law on Wednesday. A leaked draft of the law shows Timmermans� plans to propose an EU-wide 2030 target by September. The target would probably be an emissions reduction of 50-55% compared with 1990 levels, which green activists say is not enough to guarantee meeting the EU�s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.EU officials think a couple of months� difference in proposing the target makes little difference, but would allow them to bring onboard more reluctant countries, including Poland, which has not yet signed up to the EU-wide goal of net zero emissions by mid-century.The climate and environment ministers argue timing is crucial, as they want the EU to have a 2030 target, before an EU-China summit in September and well ahead of Glasgow climate talks in November. �No other major economy is prepared to take the lead to ensure an ambitious implementation of the Paris agreement,� they write.",

He applied for protection in New Zealand in 2013, claiming his and his family�s lives were at risk.The committee heard evidence of overcrowding on the island of South Tarawa, where Teitiota lived, saying that the population there had increased from 1,641 in 1947 to 50,000 in 2010 due to sea level rising leading to other islands becoming uninhabitable, which had led to violence and social tensions.He also spoke of the lack of fresh water and difficulty growing crops due to salinity of the water table causing serious health issues for his family. He said that as Kiribati was predicted to be uninhabitable in 10 to 15 years, his life was endangered by remaining there.The New Zealand courts rejected Teitiota�s claim for protection. The UN human rights committee upheld New Zealand�s decision on the grounds that while �sea level rise is likely to render the republic of Kiribati uninhabitable � the timeframe of 10 to 15 years, as suggested by [Teitiota], could allow for intervening acts by the republic of Kiribati, with the assistance of the international community, to take affirmative measures to protect and, where necessary, relocate its population�.",

Morrison said although the government will review the possibility of reaching zero emissions by 2050, in line with its Pacific Island Forum commitment, it would not adopt the target if it �didn�t know the cost�.The treasurer Josh Frydenberg backed Morrison�s position, by saying Kean was �wrong� to say cabinet ministers want the government to do more on climate change.After an unprecedented summer season of bushfires which Kean and even Morrison himself have conceded is caused in part by climate change, the federal government is under pressure to do more to fight global heating.Morrison has suggested the Coalition could go �even further� than the target of 26-28% emissions reduction by 2030, which was met with a chorus of approval from moderate Liberals but sparked warnings of negative consequences for Morrison by conservative Liberals and Nationals MPs.",

He is also still a director of News Corp, which owns the family�s newspaper interests. Peter Barnes, a board member, said the board had yet to discuss the comments.But making a public stand on the issue has also helped the 47-year-old make clear to the wider world that he is heading in a different direction from the family business, as he looks to make investments in media companies with a more liberal standpoint. He has already donated to the US presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg, joined the board of Elon Musk�s Tesla, and made clear he wants to distance himself from the conservative outlets associated with his surname.Alice Enders, of media analysts Enders, suggested Murdoch had always had a genuine and sincere concern about environmental issues throughout his career: �He and his wife believe in this so fundamentally and so strongly.
